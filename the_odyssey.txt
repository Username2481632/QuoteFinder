( crest the great teller of tales, launched out on his story: 
“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, 
what a fine thing it is to listen to such a bard 
as we have here—the man sings like a god. 
The crown of life, I’d say. There’s nothing better 
than when deep joy holds sway throughout the realm 
and banqueters up and down the palace sit in ranks, 
enthralled to hear the bard, and before them all, the tables 
heaped with bread and meats, and drawing wine from a mixing-bowl 
the steward makes his rounds and keeps the winecups flowing. 10 
This, to my mind, is the best that life can offer. 
But now 
you're set on probing the bitter pains I’ve borne, 
so I’m to weep and grieve, it seems, still more. 
Well then, what shall I go through first, 


201 


22 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [14-42] 


what shall I save for last? 
What pains—the gods have given me my share. 
Now let me begin by telling you my name... 
so you may know it well and I in times to come, 
if I can escape the fatal day, will be your host, 
your sworn friend, though my home is far from here. 20 
I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world 
for every kind of craft—my fame has reached the skies. 
Sunny Ithaca is my home. Atop her stands our seamark, 
Mount Neriton’s leafy ridges shimmering in the wind. 
Around her a ring of islands circle side-by-side, 
Dulichion, Same, wooded Zacynthus too, but mine 
lies low and away, the farthest out to sea, 
rearing into the western dusk 
while the others face the east and breaking day. 
Mine is a rugged land but good for raising sons— 30 
and I myself, I know no sweeter sight on earth 
than a man’s own native country. 

True enough, 
Calypso the lustrous goddess tried to hold me back, 
deep in her arching caverns, craving me for a husband. 
So did Circe, holding me just as warmly in her halls, 
the bewitching queen of Aeaea keen to have me too. 
But they never won the heart inside me, never. 
So nothing is as sweet as a Man’s own country, 
his own parents, even though he’s settled down 
in some luxurious house, off in a foreign land 40 
and far from those who bore him. 

No more. Come, 
let me tell you about the voyage fraught with hardship 
Zeus inflicted on me, homeward bound from Troy... 


The wind drove me out of Ilium on to Ismarus, 
the Cicones’ stronghold. There I sacked the city, 
killed the men, but as for the wives and plunder, 
that rich haul we dragged away from the place— 
we shared it round so no one, not on my account, 
would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. 


[43-75] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


Then I urged them to cut and run, set sail, 

but would they listen? Not those mutinous fools; 

there was too much wine to swill, too many sheep to slaughter 
down along the beach, and shambling longhorn cattle. 

And all the while the Cicones sought out other Cicones, 
called for help from their neighbors living inland: 

a larger force, and stronger soldiers too, 

skilled hands at fighting men from chariots, 

skilled, when a crisis broke, to fight on foot. 

Out of the morning mist they came against us— 

packed as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring— 
and Zeus presented us with disaster, me and my comrades 
doomed to suffer blow on mortal blow. Lining up, 

both armies battled it out against our swift ships, 

both raked each other with hurtling bronze lances. 

Long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger 

we stood and fought them off, massed as they were, but then, 
when the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen, 
the Cicones broke our lines and beat us down at last. 

Out of each ship, six men-at-arms were killed; 

the rest of us rowed away from certain doom. 


From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death 
yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost. 
But I would not let our rolling ships set sail until the crews 
had raised the triple cry, saluting each poor comrade 
cut down by the fierce Cicones on that plain. 
Now Zeus who masses the stormclouds hit the fleet 
with the North Wind— 

a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over 

in thunderheads the earth and sea at once— 


and night swept down 


from the sky and the ships went plunging headlong on, 
our Sails slashed to rags by the hurricane’s blast! 

We struck them—cringing at death we rowed our ships 
to the nearest shoreline, pulled with all our power. 
There, for two nights, two days, we lay by, no letup, 
eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired.

214 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [76-107] 


When Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, 
then stepping the masts and hoisting white sails high, 
we lounged at the oarlocks, letting wind and helmsmen 
keep us true on course... 

And now, at long last, 
I might have reached my native land unscathed, 
but just as I doubled Malea’s cape, a tide-rip 
and the North Wind drove me way off course 90 
careering past Cythera. 

Nine whole days 

I was borne along by rough, deadly winds 
on the fish-infested sea. Then on the tenth 
our squadron reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, 
people who eat the lotus, mellow fruit and flower. 
We disembarked on the coast, drew water there 
and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships. 
Once we'd had our fill of food and drink I sent 
a detail ahead, two picked men and a third, a runner, 100 
to scout out who might live there—men like us perhaps, 
who live on bread? So off they went and soon enough 
they mingled among the natives, Lotus-eaters, Lotus-eaters 
who had no notion of killing my companions, not at all, 
they simply gave them the lotus to taste instead... 
Any crewmen who ate the lotus, the honey-sweet fruit, 
lost all desire to send a message back, much less return, 
their only wish to linger there with the Lotus-eaters, 
grazing on lotus, all memory of the journey home 
dissolved forever. But J brought them back, back 110 
to the hollow ships, and streaming tears—I forced them, 
hauled them under the rowing benches, lashed them fast 
and shouted out commands to my other, steady comrades: 
‘Quick, no time to lose, embark in the racing ships!’— 
so none could eat the lotus, forget the voyage home. 
They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks 
and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. 


From there we sailed on, our spirits now at a low ebb, 
and reached the land of the high and mighty Cyclops, 


[107-41] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


lawless brutes, who trust so to the everlasting gods 
they never plant with their own hands or plow the soil. 
Unsown, unplowed, the earth teems with all they need, 
wheat, barley and vines, swelled by the rains of Zeus 
to yield a big full-bodied wine from clustered grapes. 
They have no meeting place for council, no laws either, 
no, up on the mountain peaks they live in arching caverns— 
each a law to himself, ruling his wives and children, 
not a care in the world for any neighbor. 

Now, 
a level island stretches flat across the harbor, 
not close inshore to the Cyclops’ coast, not too far out, 
thick with woods where the wild goats breed by hundreds. 
No trampling of men to start them from their lairs, 
no hunters roughing it out on the woody ridges, 
stalking quarry, ever raid their haven. 
No flocks browse, no plowlands roll with wheat; 
unplowed, unsown forever—empty of humankind— 
the island just feeds droves of bleating goats. 
For the Cyclops have no ships with crimson prows, 
no shipwrights there to build them good trim craft 
that could sail them out to foreign ports of call 
as most men risk the seas to trade with other men. 
Such artisans would have made this island too 
a decent place to live in... No mean spot, 
it could bear you any crop you like in season. 
The water-meadows along the low foaming shore 
run soft and moist, and your vines would never flag. 
The land’s clear for plowing. Harvest on harvest, 
a man could reap a healthy stand of grain— 
the subsoil’s dark and rich. 
There’s a snug deep-water harbor there, what’s more, 
no need for mooring-gear, no anchor-stones to heave, 
no cables to make fast. Just beach your keels, ride out 
the days till your shipmates’ spirit stirs for open sea 
and a fair wind blows. And last, at the harbor’s head 
there’s a spring that rushes fresh from beneath a cave 
and black poplars flourish round its mouth.

216 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


Well, 
here we landed, and surely a god steered us in 
through the pitch-black night. 

Not that he ever showed himself, with thick fog 
swirling around the ships, the moon wrapped in clouds 
and not a glimmer stealing through that gloom. 

Not one of us glimpsed the island—scanning hard— 

or the long combers rolling us slowly toward the coast, 
not till our ships had run their keels ashore. 

Beaching our vessels smoothly, striking sail, 

the crews swung out on the low shelving sand 

and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn’s first light. 


When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 


we all turned out, intrigued to tour the island. 
The local nymphs, the daughters of Zeus himself, 


flushed mountain-goats so the crews could make their meal. 
Quickly we fetched our curved bows and hunting spears 


from the ships and, splitting up into three bands, 
we started shooting, and soon enough some god 
had sent us bags of game to warm our hearts. 

A dozen vessels sailed in my command 

and to each crew nine goats were shared out 

and mine alone took ten. Then all day long 

till the sun went down we sat and feasted well 

on sides of meat and rounds of heady wine. 

The good red stock in our vessels’ holds 

had not run out, there was still plenty left; 

the men had carried off a generous store in jars 
when we stormed and sacked the Cicones’ holy city. 
Now we stared across at the Cyclops’ shore, so near 
we could even see their smoke, hear their voices, 
their bleating sheep and goats... 

And then when the sun had set and night came on 
we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge. 


When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 


I called a muster briskly, commanding all the hands, 
‘The rest of you stay here, my friends-in-arms.

[173-205] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


I'll go across with my own ship and crew 
and probe the natives living over there. 
What are they—violent, savage, lawless? 
or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?’ 


With that I boarded ship and told the crew 
to embark at once and cast off cables quickly. 
They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks 
and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. 
But as soon as we reached the coast I mentioned—no long trip— 
we spied a cavern just at the shore, gaping above the surf, 
towering, overgrown with laurel. And here big flocks, 
sheep and goats, were stalled to spend the nights, 
and around its mouth a yard was walled up 
with quarried boulders sunk deep in the earth 
and enormous pines and oak-trees looming darkly ... 
Here was a giant’s lair, in fact, who always pastured 
his sheepflocks far afield and never mixed with others. 
A grim loner, dead set in his own lawless ways. 
Here was a piece of work, by god, a monster 
built like no mortal who ever supped on bread, 
no, like a shaggy peak, I’d say—a man-mountain 
rearing head and shoulders over the world. 

Now then, 

I told most of my good trusty crew to wait, 
to sit tight by the ship and guard her well 
while I picked out my dozen finest fighters 
and off I went. But I took a skin of wine along, 
the ruddy, irresistible wine that Maron gave me once, 
Euanthes’ son, a priest of Apollo, lord of Ismarus, 
because we'd rescued him, his wife and children, 
reverent as we were; 
he lived, you see, in Apollo’s holy grove. 
And so in return he gave me splendid gifts, 
he handed me seven bars of well-wrought gold, 
a mixing-bowl of solid silver, then this wine... 
He drew it off in generous wine-jars, twelve in all, 
all unmixed—and such a bouquet, a drink fit for the gods!

218 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [205~33] 


No maid or man of his household knew that secret store, 

only himself, his loving wife and a single servant. 230 
Whenever they'd drink the deep-red mellow vintage, 

twenty cups of water he’d stir in one of wine 

and what an aroma wafted from the bowl— 

what magic, what a godsend— 

no joy in holding back when that was poured! 

Filling a great goatskin now, I took this wine, 

provisions too in a leather sack. A sudden foreboding 

told my fighting spirit I’d soon come up against 

some giant clad in power like armor-plate— 

a savage deaf to justice, blind to law. 240 


Our party quickly made its way to his cave 
but we failed to find our host himself inside; 
he was off in his pasture, ranging his sleek flocks. 
So we explored his den, gazing wide-eyed at it all, 
the large flat racks loaded with drying cheeses, 
the folds crowded with young lambs and kids, 
split into three groups—here the spring-born, 
here mid-yearlings, here the fresh sucklings 
off to the side—each sort was penned apart. 
And all his vessels, pails and hammered buckets 250 
he used for milking, were brimming full with whey. 
From the start my comrades pressed me, pleading hard, 
‘Let’s make away with the cheeses, then come back— 
hurry, drive the lambs and kids from the pens 
to our swift ship, put out to sea at once!’ 
But I would not give way— 
and how much better it would have been— 
not till I saw him, saw what gifts he’d give. 
But he proved no lovely sight to my companions. 


There we built a fire, set our hands on the cheeses, | 260 
offered some to the gods and ate the bulk ourselves 
and settled down inside, awaiting his return... 
And back he came from pasture, late in the day, 
herding his flocks home, and lugging a huge load 


[234-67] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


of good dry logs to fuel his fire at supper. 

He flung them down in the cave—a jolting crash— 

we scuttled in panic into the deepest dark recess. 

And next he drove his sleek flocks into the open vault, 
all he’d milk at least, but he left the males outside, 

rams and billy goats out in the high-walled yard. 

Then to close his door he hoisted overhead 

a tremendous, massive slab— 

no twenty-two wagons, rugged and four-wheeled, 
could budge that boulder off the ground, I tell you, 
such an immense stone the monster wedged to block his cave! 
Then down he squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats, 
each in order, and put a suckling underneath each dam. 
And half of the fresh white milk he curdled quickly, 

set it aside in wicker racks to press for cheese, 

the other half let stand in pails and buckets, 

ready at hand to wash his supper down. 

As soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores 

he lit his fire and spied us in the blaze and 

‘Strangers!’ he thundered out, ‘now who are you? 
Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes? 
Out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates, 
sea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives 

to plunder other men?’ 

The hearts inside us shook, 
terrified by his rumbling voice and monstrous hulk. 
Nevertheless I found the nerve to answer, firmly, 

‘Men of Achaea we are and bound now from Troy! 
Driven far off course by the warring winds, 

over the vast gulf of the sea—battling home 

on a strange tack, a route that’s off the map, 

and so we’ve come to you... 

so it must please King Zeus’s plotting heart. 

We're glad to say we’re men of Atrides Agamemnon, 
whose fame is the proudest thing on earth these days, 
so great a city he sacked, such multitudes he killed! 
But since we’ve chanced on you, we’re at your knees 
in hopes of a warm welcome, even a guest-gift, 


209 


270 


280 


290 


300 


220 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [268-99] 


the sort that hosts give strangers. That’s the custom. 

Respect the gods, my friend. We're suppliants—at your mercy! 
Zeus of the Strangers guards all guests and suppliants: 
strangers are sacred—Zeus will avenge their rights!’ 


‘Stranger,’ he grumbled back from his brutal heart, 
‘you must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere, 
telling me to fear the gods or avoid their wrath! 
We Cyclops never blink at Zeus and Zeus’s shield 
of storm and thunder, or any other blessed god— 310 
we've got more force by far. 
I’d never spare you in fear of Zeus’s hatred, 
you or your comrades here, unless I had the urge. 
But tell me, where did you moor your sturdy ship 
when you arrived? Up the coast or close in? 
I’d just like to know.’ 

So he laid his trap 

but he never caught me, no, wise to the world 
I shot back in my crafty way, ‘My ship? 
Poseidon god of the earthquake smashed my ship, 
he drove it against the rocks at your island’s far cape, 320 
he dashed it against a cliff as the winds rode us in. 
I and the men you see escaped a sudden death.’ 


Not a word in reply to that, the ruthless brute. 
Lurching up, he lunged out with his hands toward my men 
and snatching two at once, rapping them on the ground 
he knocked them dead like pups— 
their brains gushed out all over, soaked the floor— 
and ripping them limb from limb to fix his meal 
he bolted them down like a mountain-lion, left no scrap, 
devoured entrails, flesh and bones, marrow and all! 330 
We flung our arms to Zeus, we wept and cried aloud, 
looking on at his grisly work—paralyzed, appalled. 
But once the Cyclops had stuffed his enormous gut 
with human flesh, washing it down with raw milk, 
he slept in his cave, stretched out along his flocks. 
And I with my fighting heart, I thought at first 


[300-34] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


to steal up to him, draw the sharp sword at my hip 

and stab his chest where the midriff packs the liver— 

I groped for the fatal spot but a fresh thought held me back. 
There at a stroke we'd finish off ourselves as well— 

how could we with our bare hands heave back 

that slab he set to block his cavern’s gaping maw? 

So we lay there groaning, waiting Dawn’s first light. 


When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 


the monster relit his fire and milked his handsome ewes, 
each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam, 
and as soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores 

he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal. 
Well-fed, he drove his fat sheep from the cave, 

lightly lifting the huge doorslab up and away, 

then slipped it back in place 

as a hunter flips the lid of his quiver shut. 

Piercing whistles—turning his flocks to the hills 

he left me there, the heart inside me brooding on revenge: 
how could I pay him back? would Athena give me glory? 
Here was the plan that struck my mind as best... 

the Cyclops’ great club: there it lay by the pens, 
olivewood, full of sap. He’d lopped it off to brandish 

once it dried. Looking it over, we judged it big enough 

to be the mast of a pitch-black ship with her twenty oars, 
a freighter broad in the beam that plows through miles of sea— 
so long, so thick it bulked before our eyes. Well, 

flanking it now, I chopped off a fathom’s length, 

rolled it to comrades, told them to plane it down, 

and they made the club smooth as I bent and shaved 

the tip to a stabbing point. I turned it over 

the blazing fire to char it good and hard, 

then hid it well, buried deep under the dung 

that littered the cavern’s floor in thick wet clumps. 

And now I ordered my shipmates all to cast lots— 

who'd brave it out with me 

to hoist our stake and grind it into his eye 

when sleep had overcome him? Luck of the draw: 


221 


340 


350 


360 


370 


222 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [334-64] 


I got the very ones I would have picked myself, 
four good men, and I in the lead made five. . . 


Nightfall brought him back, herding his woolly sheep 
and he quickly drove the sleek flock into the vaulted cavern, 
rams and all—none left outside in the walled yard— 
his own idea, perhaps, or a god led him on. 
Then he hoisted the huge slab to block the door 380 
and squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats, 
each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam, 
and as soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores 
he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal. 
But this time I lifted a carved wooden bowl, 
brimful of my ruddy wine, 
and went right up to the Cyclops, enticing, 
‘Here, Cyclops, try this wine—to top off 
the banquet of human flesh you’ve bolted down! 
Judge for yourself what stock our ship had stored. 390 
I brought it here to make you a fine libation, 
hoping you would pity me, Cyclops, send me home, 
but your rages are insufferable. You barbarian— 
how can any man on earth come visit you after this? 
What you've done outrages all that’s right!’ 


At that he seized the bowl and tossed it off 
and the heady wine pleased him immensely—’ More’— 
he demanded a second bow!—“a hearty helping! 
And tell me your name now, quickly, 
so I can hand my guest a gift to warm his heart. 400 
Our soil yields the Cyclops powerful, full-bodied wine 
and the rains from Zeus build its strength. But this, 
this is nectar, ambrosia—this flows from heaven!’ 


So he declared. I poured him another fiery bowl— 
three bowls I brimmed and three he drank to the last drop, 
the fool, and then, when the wine was swirling round his brain, 
I approached my host with a cordial, winning word: 
‘So, you ask me the name I’m known by, Cyclops? 


[364-95] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


I will tell you. But you must give me a guest-gift 
as you've promised. Nobody—that’s my name. Nobody— 
so my mother and father call me, all my friends.’ 


But he boomed back at me from his ruthless heart, 
‘Nobody? I'll eat Nobody last of all his friends— 
I’ll eat the others first! That’s my gift to you!” 

With that 
he toppled over, sprawled full-length, flat on his back 
and lay there, his massive neck slumping to one side, 
and sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now 
as wine came spurting, flooding up from his gullet 
with chunks of human flesh—he vomited, blind drunk. 
Now, at last, I thrust our stake in a bed of embers 
to get it red-hot and rallied all my comrades: 
‘Courage—no panic, no one hang back now!’ 

And green as it was, just as the olive stake 
was about to catch fire—the glow terrific, yes— 
I dragged it from the flames, my men clustering round 
as some god breathed enormous courage through us all. 
Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point, 
straight into the monster’s eye they rammed it hard— 
I drove my weight on it from above and bored it home 
as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright’s drill 
that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl 
and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping— J 
So we seized our stake with its fiery tip : 
and bored it round and round in the giant’s eye 
till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft 
and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core 
and the broiling eyeball burst— 
its crackling roots blazed 

and hissed— 

as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze 
in an ice-cold bath and the metal screeches steam 
and its temper hardens—that’s the iron’s strength— 
so the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake! 
He loosed a hideous roar, the rock walls echoed round 


223 


410 


420 


430 


440 


224 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [396-426] 


and we scuttled back in terror. The monster wrenched the spike 
from his eye and out it came with a red geyser of blood— 

he flung it aside with frantic hands, and mad with pain 

he bellowed out for help from his neighbor Cyclops 

living round about in caves on windswept crags. 

Hearing his cries, they lumbered up from every side 

and hulking round his cavern, asked what ailed him: 

‘What, Polyphemus, what in the world’s the trouble? 450 
Roaring out in the godsent night to rob us of our sleep. 

Surely no one’s rustling your flocks against your will— 

surely no one’s trying to kill you now by fraud or force!’ 


‘Nobody, friends’—Polyphemus bellowed back from his cave— 
‘Nobody’s killing me now by fraud and not by force!’ 


‘If you’re alone,’ his friends boomed back at once, 
‘and nobody’s trying to overpower you now—look, 
it must be a plague sent here by mighty Zeus 
and there’s no escape from that. 
You'd better pray to your father, Lord Poseidon.’ 460 


They lumbered off, but laughter filled my heart 
to think how nobody’s name—my great cunning stroke— 
had duped them one and all. But the Cyclops there, 
still groaning, racked with agony, groped around 
for the huge slab, and heaving it from the doorway, 
down he sat in the cave’s mouth, his arms spread wide, 
hoping to catch a comrade stealing out with sheep— 
such a blithering fool he took me for! 
But I was already plotting... 
what was the best way out? how could I find 470 
escape from death for my crew, myself as well? 
My wits kept weaving, weaving cunning schemes— 
life at stake, monstrous death staring us in the face— 
till this plan struck my mind as best. That flock, 
those well-fed rams with their splendid thick fleece, 
sturdy, handsome beasts sporting their dark weight of wool: 


[427-58] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


I lashed them abreast, quietly, twisting the willow-twigs 
the Cyclops slept on—giant, lawless brute—I took them 
three by three; each ram in the middle bore a man 
while the two rams either side would shield him well. 
So three beasts to bear each man, but as for myself? 
There was one bellwether ram, the prize of all the flock, 
and clutching him by his back, tucked up under 

his shaggy belly, there I hung, face upward, 

both hands locked in his marvelous deep fleece, 
clinging for dear life, my spirit steeled, enduring... 

So we held on, desperate, waiting Dawn’s first light. 

As soon 
as young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 
the rams went rumbling out of the cave toward pasture, 
the ewes kept bleating round the pens, unmilked, 
their udders about to burst. Their master now, 
heaving in torment, felt the back of each animal 
halting before him here, but the idiot never sensed 
my men were trussed up under their thick fleecy ribs. 
And last of them all came my great ram now, striding out, 
weighed down with his dense wool and my deep plots. 
Stroking him gently, powerful Polyphemus murmured, 
‘Dear old ram, why last of the flock to quit the cave? 

In the good old days you'd never lag behind the rest— 
you with your long marching strides, first by far 

of the flock to graze the fresh young grasses, 

first by far to reach the rippling streams, 

first to turn back home, keen for your fold 

when night comes on—but now you're last of all. 

And why? Sick at heart for your master’s eye 

that coward gouged out with his wicked crew?— 

only after he’d stunned my wits with wine— 

that, that Nobody... 

who’s not escaped his death, I swear, not yet. 

Oh if only you thought like me, had words like me 

to tell me where that scoundrel is cringing from my rage! 
I'd smash him against the ground, I'd spill his brains—

flooding across my cave—and that would ease my heart 
of the pains that good-for-nothing Nobody made me suffer!’ 


And with that threat he let my ram go free outside. 
But soon as we'd got one foot past cave and courtyard, 
first I loosed myself from the ram, then loosed my men, 
then quickly, glancing back again and again we drove 
our flock, good plump beasts with their long shanks, 
straight to the ship, and a welcome sight we were 520 
to loyal comrades—we who'd escaped our deaths— 
but for all the rest they broke down and wailed. 
I cut it short, I stopped each shipmate’s cries, 
my head tossing, brows frowning, silent signals 
to hurry, tumble our fleecy herd on board, 
launch out on the open sea! 
They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks 
and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. 
But once offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry, 
I called back to the Cyclops, stinging taunts: 530 
‘So, Cyclops, no weak coward it was whose crew 
you bent to devour there in your vaulted cave— 
you with your brute force! Your filthy crimes 
came down on your own head, you shameless cannibal, 
daring to eat your guests in your own house— 
so Zeus and the other gods have paid you back!’ 


That made the rage of the monster boil over. 
Ripping off the peak of a towering crag, he heaved it 
so hard the boulder landed just in front of our dark prow 
and a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under— 540 
a tidal wave from the open sea. The sudden backwash 
drove us landward again, forcing us close inshore 
but grabbing a long pole, I thrust us off and away, 
tossing my head for dear life, signaling crews 
to put their backs in the oars, escape grim death. 
They threw themselves in the labor, rowed on fast 
but once we’d plowed the breakers twice as far, 
again I began to taunt the Cyclops—men around me 


[493-523] BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


trying to check me, calm me, left and right: 
‘So headstrong—why? Why rile the beast again?’ 


‘That rock he flung in the sea just now, hurling our ship 
to shore once more—we thought we'd die on the spot!’ 


‘If he’d caught a sound from one of us, just a moan, 
he would have crushed our heads and ship timbers 
with one heave of another flashing, jagged rock!’ 


‘Good god, the brute can throw!’ 
So they begged 

but they could not bring my fighting spirit round. 
I called back with another burst of anger, ‘Cyclops— 
if any man on the face of the earth should ask you 
who blinded you, shamed you so—say Odysseus, 
raider of cities, he gouged out your eye, 
Laertes’ son who makes his home in Ithaca!’ 


So I vaunted and he groaned back in answer, 
‘Oh no, no—that prophecy years ago... 
it all comes home to me with a vengeance now! 
We once had a prophet here, a great tall man, 
Telemus, Eurymus’ son, a master at reading signs, 
who grew old in his trade among his fellow-Cyclops. 
All this, he warned me, would come to pass someday— 
that I’d be blinded here at the hands of one Odysseus. 
But I always looked for a handsome giant man to cross my path, 
some fighter clad in power like armor-plate, but now, 
look what a dwarf, a spineless good-for-nothing, 
stuns me with wine, then gouges out my eye! 
Come here, Odysseus, let me give you a guest-gift 
and urge Poseidon the earthquake god to speed you home. 
I am his son and he claims to be my father, true, 
and he himself will heal me if he pleases— 
no other blessed god, no man can do the work!’ 

‘Heal you!’— 

here was my parting shot—’Would to god I could strip you 


227 


550 


560 


570 


580 


228 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [523-52] 


of life and breath and ship you down to the House of Death 
as surely as no one will ever heal your eye, 
not even your earthquake god himself!’ 


But at that he bellowed out to lord Poseidon, 
thrusting his arms to the starry skies, and prayed, ‘Hear me— 
Poseidon, god of the sea-blue mane who rocks the earth! 
If I really am your son and you claim to be my father— 
come, grant that Odysseus, raider of cities, 
Laertes’ son who makes his home in Ithaca, 
never reaches home. Or if he’s fated to see 590 
his people once again and reach his well-built house 
and his own native country, let him come home late 
and come a broken man—all shipmates lost, 
alone in a stranger’s ship— 
and let him find a world of pain at home!’ 

So he prayed 

and the god of the sea-blue mane, Poseidon, heard his prayer. 
The monster suddenly hoisted a boulder—far larger— 
wheeled and heaved it, putting his weight behind it, 
massive strength, and the boulder crashed close, 
landing just in the wake of our dark stern, 600 
just failing to graze the rudder’s bladed edge. 
A huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under, 
yes, and the tidal breaker drove us out to our island’s 
far shore where all my well-decked ships lay moored, 
clustered, waiting, and huddled round them, crewmen 
sat in anguish, waiting, chafing for our return. 
We beached our vessel hard ashore on the sand, 
we swung out in the frothing surf ourselves, 
and herding Cyclops’ sheep from our deep holds 
we shared them round so no one, not on my account, 610 
would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. 
But the splendid ram—as we meted out the flocks 
my friends-in-arms made him my prize of honor, 
mine alone, and I slaughtered him on the beach 
and burnt his thighs to Cronus’ mighty son, 
Zeus of the thundercloud who rules the world. 


[553-66] - BOOK 9: IN THE ONE-EYED GIANT’S CAVE 


But my sacrifices failed to move the god: 

Zeus was still obsessed with plans to destroy 

my entire oarswept fleet and loyal crew of comrades. 

Now all day long till the sun went down we sat 

and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine. 

Then when the sun had set and night came on 

we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge. 

When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 
I roused the men straightway, ordering all crews 

to man the ships and cast off cables quickly. 

They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks 

and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. 
And from there we sailed on, glad to escape our death 

yet sick at heart for the comrades we had lost.”

Queen of Aeaea 


Md 
e reached the Aeolian island next, the home of Aeolus, 


Hippotas’ son, beloved by the gods who never die— 

a great floating island it was, and round it all 

huge ramparts rise of indestructible bronze 

and sheer rock cliffs shoot up from sea to sky. 

The king had sired twelve children within his halls, 

six daughters and six sons in the lusty prime of youth, 

so he gave his daughters as wives to his six sons. 

Seated beside their dear father and doting mother, 

with delicacies aplenty spread before them, 10 
they feast on forever... All day long 
the halls breathe the savor of roasted meats 

and echo round to the low moan of blowing pipes, 

and all night long, each one by his faithful mate, 

they sleep under soft-piled rugs on corded bedsteads. 


230 


[13-44] meex 10: THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF AEAEA 


To this city of theirs we came, their splendid palace, 


and Aeolus hosted me one entire month, he pressed me for news 


of Troy and the Argive ships and how we sailed for home, 
and I told him the whole long story, first to last. 

And then, when I begged him to send me on my way, 

he denied me nothing, he went about my passage. 

He gave me a Sack, the skin of a full-grown ox, 

binding inside the winds that howl from every quarter, 
for Zeus had made that king the master of all the winds, 


with power to calm them down or rouse them as he pleased. 


Aeolus stowed the sack inside my holds, lashed so fast 
with a burnished silver cord 

not even a slight puff could slip past that knot. 

Yet he set the West Wind free to blow us on our way 


and waft our squadron home. But his plan was bound to fail, 


yes, our own reckless folly swept us on to ruin... 


Nine whole days we sailed, nine nights, nonstop. 
On the tenth our own land hove into sight at last— 
we were so close we could see men tending fires. 
But now an enticing sleep came on me, bone-weary 
from working the vessel’s sheet myself, no letup, 
never trusting the ropes to any other mate, 
the faster to journey back to native land. 

But the crews began to mutter among themselves, 

sure I was hauling troves of gold and silver home, 

the gifts of open-hearted Aeolus, Hippotas’ son. 

‘The old story!’ One man glanced at another, grumbling. 
‘Look at our captain’s luck—so loved by the world, 

so prized at every landfall, every port of call.’ 


‘Heaps of lovely plunder he hauls home from Troy, 
while we who went through slogging just as hard, 
we go home empty-handed.’ 
‘Now this Aeolus loads him 
down with treasure. Favoritism, friend to friend!’ 


‘Hurry, let’s see what loot is in that sack, 


23:1 


20 


30 


40 


232 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [45-75] 


how much gold and silver. Break it open—now!’ 50 


A fatal plan, but it won my shipmates over. 
They loosed the sack and all the winds burst out 
and a sudden squall struck and swept us back to sea, 
wailing, in tears, far from our own native land. 
And I woke up with a start, my spirit churning— 
should I leap over the side and drown at once or 
grit my teeth and bear it, stay among the living? 
I bore it all, held firm, hiding my face, 
clinging tight to the decks 
while heavy squalls blasted our squadron back 60 
again to Aeolus’ island, shipmates groaning hard. 


We disembarked on the coast, drew water there 
and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships. 
Once we’d had our fill of food and drink 
I took a shipmate along with me, a herald too, 
and approached King Aeolus’ famous halls and here 
we found him feasting beside his wife and many children. 
Reaching the doorposts at the threshold, down we sat 
but our hosts, amazed to see us, only shouted questions: 
‘Back again, Odysseus—why? Some blustering god attacked you? 70 
Surely we launched you well, we sped you on your way 
to your own land and house, or any place you pleased.’ 


So they taunted, and I replied in deep despair, 
‘A mutinous crew undid me—that and a cruel sleep. 
Set it to rights, my friends. You have the power!’ 


So I pleaded—gentle, humble appeals— 
but our hosts turned silent, hushed... 
and the father broke forth with an ultimatum: 
‘Away from my island—fast—most cursed man alive! 
It’s a crime to host a man or speed him on his way 80 
when the blessed deathless gods despise him so. 
Crawling back like this— 


[75-106] Book 10: THE BEWITCGCHING QUEEN OF AEAEA 


it proves the immortals hate you! Out—get out!’ 


Groan as I did, his curses drove me from his halls 
and from there we pulled away with heavy hearts, 
with the crews’ spirit broken under the oars’ labor, 
thanks to our own folly ... no favoring wind in sight. 


Six whole days we rowed, six nights, nonstop. 
On the seventh day we raised the Laestrygonian land, 
Telepylus heights where the craggy fort of Lamus rises. 
Where shepherd calls to shepherd as one drives in his flocks 
and the other drives his out and he calls back in answer, 
where a man who never sleeps could rake in double wages, 
one for herding cattle, one for pasturing fleecy sheep, 
the nightfall and the sunrise march so close together. 
We entered a fine harbor there, all walled around 
by a great unbroken sweep of sky-scraping cliff 
and two steep headlands, fronting each other, close 
around the mouth so the passage in is cramped. 
Here the rest of my rolling squadron steered, 
right into the gaping cove and moored tightly, 
prow by prow. Never a swell there, big or small; 
a milk-white calm spreads all around the place. 
But I alone anchored my black ship outside, 
well clear of the harbor’s jaws 
I tied her fast to a cliffside with a cable. 
I scaled its rock face to a lookout on its crest 
but glimpsed no trace of the work of man or beast from there; 
all I spied was a plume of smoke, drifting off the land. 
So I sent some crew ahead to learn who lived there— 
men like us perhaps, who live on bread? 
Two good mates I chose and a third to run the news. 
They disembarked and set out on a beaten trail 
the wagons used for hauling timber down to town 
from the mountain heights above . . . 
and before the walls they met a girl, drawing water, 
Antiphates’ strapping daughter—king of the Laestrygonians.

234 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [107-40] 


She’d come down to a clear running spring, Artacia, 

where the local people came to fill their pails. 

My shipmates clustered round her, asking questions: 120 
who was king of the realm? who ruled the natives here? 

She waved at once to her father’s high-roofed halls. 

They entered the sumptuous palace, found his wife inside— 

a woman huge as a mountain crag who filled them all with horror. 
Straightaway she summoned royal Antiphates from assembly, 

her husband, who prepared my crew a barbarous welcome. 

Snatching one of my men, he tore him up for dinner— 

the other two sprang free and reached the ships. 

But the king let loose a howling through the town 

that brought tremendous Laestrygonians swarming up 130 
from every side—hundreds, not like men, like Giants! 

Down from the cliffs they flung great rocks a man could hardly hoist 
and a ghastly shattering din rose up from all the ships— 

men in their death-cries, hulls smashed to splinters— 

They speared the crews like fish 

and whisked them home to make their grisly meal. 

But while they killed them off in the harbor depths 

I pulled the sword from beside my hip and hacked away 

at the ropes that moored my blue-prowed ship of war 

and shouted rapid orders at my shipmates: 140 
‘Put your backs in the oars—now row or die!’ 

In terror of death they ripped the swells—all as one— 

and what a joy as we darted out toward open sea, 

clear of those beetling cliffs . .. my ship alone. 

But the rest went down en masse. Our squadron sank. 


From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death 
yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost. 
We reached the Aeaean island next, the home of Circe 
the nymph with lovely braids, an awesome power too 
who can speak with human voice, | 150 
the true sister of murderous-minded Aeetes. 
Both were bred by the Sun who lights our lives; 
their mother was Perse, a child the Ocean bore. 
We brought our ship to port without a sound 


[141-75] Boek 10; THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF AEABA 


as a god eased her into a harbor safe and snug, 

and for two days and two nights we lay by there, 

eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired. 
When Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, 
at last I took my spear and my sharp sword again, 
rushed up from the ship to find a lookout point, 

hoping to glimpse some sign of human labor, 

catch some human voices... 

I scaled a commanding crag and, scanning hard, 

I could just make out some smoke from Circe’s halls, 
drifting up from the broad terrain through brush and woods. 
Mulling it over, I thought I’d scout the ground— 

that fire aglow in the smoke, I saw it, true, 

but soon enough this seemed the better plan: 

I’d go back to shore and the swift ship first, 

feed the men, then send them out for scouting. 

I was well on my way down, nearing our ship 

when a god took pity on me, wandering all alone; 

he sent me a big stag with high branching antlers, 

right across my path—the sun’s heat forced him down 
from his forest range to drink at a river’s banks— 

just bounding out of the timber when I hit him 

square in the backbone, halfway down the spine 

and my bronze spear went punching clean through— 
he dropped in the dust, groaning, gasping out his breath. 


Treading on him, I wrenched my bronze spear from the wound, 


left it there on the ground, and snapping off some twigs 
and creepers, twisted a rope about a fathom long, 

I braided it tight, hand over hand, then lashed 

the four hocks of that magnificent beast. 

Loaded round my neck I lugged him toward the ship, 
trudging, propped on my spear—no way to sling him 
over a shoulder, steadying him with one free arm— 
the kill was so immense! 

I flung him down by the hull and roused the men, 
going up to them all with a word to lift their spirits: 
‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship— 
we won't go down to the House of Death, not yet, 


235 


160 


170 


180 


190 


236 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [175-208] 


not till our day arrives. Up with you, look, 
there’s still some meat and drink in our good ship. 
Put our minds on food—why die of hunger here?’ 


My hardy urging brought them round at once. 
Heads came up from cloaks and there by the barren sea 
they gazed at the stag, their eyes wide—my noble trophy. 
But once they'd looked their fill and warmed their hearts, 
they washed their hands and prepared a splendid meal. 200 
Now all day long till the sun went down we sat 
and feasted on sides of meat and seasoned wine. 
Then when the sun had set and night came on 
we lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge. 
When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 
I called a muster quickly, informing all the crew, 
‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship, 
we can’t tell east from west, the dawn from the dusk, 
nor where the sun that lights our lives goes under earth 
nor where it rises. We must think of a plan at once, 210 
some cunning stroke. I doubt there’s one still left. 
I scaled a commanding crag and from that height 
surveyed an entire island 
ringed like a crown by endless wastes of sea. 
But the land itself lies low, and I did see smoke 
drifting up from its heart through thick brush and woods.’ 


My message broke their spirit as they recalled 
the gruesome work of the Laestrygonian king Antiphates 
and the hearty cannibal Cyclops thirsting for our blood. 
They burst into cries, wailing, streaming live tears 220 
that gained us nothing—what good can come of grief? 


And so, numbering off my band of men-at-arms 
into two platoons, I assigned them each a leader: 
I took one and lord Eurylochus the other. 
We quickly shook lots in a bronze helmet— 
the lot of brave Eurylochus leapt out first. 
So he moved off with his two and twenty comrades, 


[209-40] meres 10: THE BEWITCHING QUEPEN OF ABPAEA 


weeping, leaving us behind in tears as well... 

Deep in the wooded glens they came on Circe’s palace 
built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land. 

Mountain wolves and lions were roaming round the grounds— 
she’d bewitched them herself, she gave them magic drugs. 
But they wouldn’t attack my men; they just came pawing 
up around them, fawning, swishing their long tails— 
eager as hounds that fawn around their master, 

coming home from a feast, 

who always brings back scraps to calm them down. 

So they came nuzzling round my men—lions, wolves 
with big powerful claws—and the men cringed in fear 

at the sight of those strange, ferocious beasts . . . But still 
they paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids, 
Circe—and deep inside they heard her singing, lifting 

her spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth 

at her great immortal loom, her enchanting web 

a shimmering glory only goddesses can weave. 

Polites, captain of armies, took command, 

the closest, most devoted man I had: ‘Friends, 

there’s someone inside, plying a great loom, 

and how she sings—enthralling! 

The whole house is echoing to her song. 

Goddess or woman—let’s call out to her now!’ 


So he urged and the men called out and hailed her. 
She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, 
inviting them all in, and in they went, all innocence. 
Only Eurylochus stayed behind—he sensed a trap... 
She ushered them in to sit on high-backed chairs, 
then she mixed them a potion—cheese, barley 
and pale honey mulled in Pramnian wine— 
but into the brew she stirred her wicked drugs 
to wipe from their memories any thought of home. 
Once they’d drained the bowls she filled, suddenly 
she struck with her wand, drove them into her pigsties, 
all of them bristling into swine—with grunts, 
snouts—even their bodies, yes, and only 


eo

the men’s minds stayed steadfast as before. 

So off they went to their pens, sobbing, squealing 
as Circe flung them acorns, cornel nuts and mast, 
common fodder for hogs that root and roll in mud. 


Back Eurylochus ran to our swift black ship 
to tell the disaster our poor friends had faced. 270 
But try as he might, he couldn’t get a word out. 
Numbing sorrow had stunned the man to silence— 
tears welled in his eyes, his heart possessed by grief. 
We assailed him with questions—all at our wits’ end— 
till at last he could recount the fate our friends had met: 
‘Off we went through the brush, captain, as you commanded. 
Deep in the wooded glens we came on Circe’s palace 
built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land. 
Someone inside was plying a great loom, 
and how she sang—in a high clear voice! 280 
Goddess or woman—we called out and hailed her... 
She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, 
inviting us all in, and in we went, all innocence. 
But J stayed behind—I sensed a trap. Suddenly 
all vanished—blotted out—not one face showed again, 
though I sat there keeping watch a good long time.’ 


At that report I slung the hefty bronze blade 
of my silver-studded sword around my shoulder, 
slung my bow on too and told our comrade, 
‘Lead me back by the same way that you came.’ 290 
But he flung both arms around my knees and pleaded, 
begging me with his tears and winging words: 
‘Don’t force me back there, captain, king— 
leave me here on the spot. 
You will never return yourself, I swear, 
you'll never bring back a single man alive. 
Quick, cut and run with the rest of us here— 
we can still escape the fatal day!’ 


But I shot back, ‘Eurylochus, stay right here, 


[272-302] Book 10. "THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF ABAEA 


eating, drinking, safe by the black ship. 
I must be off. Necessity drives me on.’ 


Leaving the ship and shore, I headed inland, 
clambering up through hushed, entrancing glades until, 
as I was nearing the halls of Circe skilled in spells, 
approaching her palace—Hermes god of the golden wand 
crossed my path, and he looked for all the world 
like a young man sporting his first beard, 
just in the prime and warm pride of youth, 
and grasped me by the hand and asked me kindly, 
‘Where are you going now, my unlucky friend— 
trekking over the hills alone in unfamiliar country? 
And your men are all in there, in Circe’s palace, 
cooped like swine, hock by jowl in the sties. 

Have you come to set them free? 
Well, I warn you, you won’t get home yourself, 
you'll stay right there, trapped with all the rest. 
But wait, I can save you, free you from that great danger. 
Look, here is a potent drug. Take it to Circe’s halls— 
its power alone will shield you from the fatal day. 
Let me tell you of all the witch’s subtle craft... 
She'll mix you a potion, lace the brew with drugs 
but she'll be powerless to bewitch you, even so— 
this magic herb I give will fight her spells. 
Now here’s your plan of action, step by step. 
The moment Circe strikes with her long thin wand, 
you draw your sharp sword sheathed at your hip 
and rush her fast as if to run her through! 
She’ll cower in fear and coax you to her bed— 
but don’t refuse the goddess’ bed, not then, not if 
she’s to release your friends and treat you well yourself. 
But have her swear the binding oath of the blessed gods 
she’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm you, 
once you lie there naked— 
never unman you, strip away your courage!’ 
With that 
the giant-killer handed over the magic herb,

pulling it from the earth, 
and Hermes showed me all its name and nature. 
Its root is black and its flower white as milk 
and the gods call it moly. Dangerous for a mortal man 
to pluck from the soil but not for deathless gods. 340 
All lies within their power. 
Now Hermes went his way 
to the steep heights of Olympus, over the island’s woods 
while I, just approaching the halls of Circe, 
my heart a heaving storm at every step, 
paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids— 
I stood and shouted to her there. She heard my voice, 
she opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, 
inviting me in, and in I went, all anguish now... 
She led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair, 
ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet. 350 
In a golden bowl she mixed a potion for me to drink, 
stirring her poison in, her heart aswirl with evil. 
And then she passed it on, I drank it down 
but it never worked its spell— 
she struck with her wand and ‘Now,’ she cried, 
‘off to your sty, you swine, and wallow with your friends!’ 
But I, I drew my sharp sword sheathed at my hip 
and rushed her fast as if to run her through— 
She screamed, slid under my blade, hugged my knees 
with a flood of warm tears and a burst of winging words: 360 
‘Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents? 
I’m wonderstruck—you drank my drugs, you’re not bewitched! 
Never has any other man withstood my potion, never, 
once it’s past his lips and he has drunk it down. 
You have a mind in you no magic can enchant! 
You must be Odysseus, man of twists and turns— 
Hermes the giant-killer, god of the golden wand, 
he always said you’d come, 
homeward bound from Troy in your swift black ship. 
Come, sheathe your sword, let’s go to bed together, 370 
mount my bed and mix in the magic work of love— 
we'll breed deep trust between us.’ 


[336-69] Poon LO: THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF AEBAEA 


So she enticed 
but I fought back, still wary. ‘Circe, Circe, 
how dare you tell me to treat you with any warmth? 
You who turned my men to swine in your own house and now 
you hold me here as well—teeming with treachery 
you lure me to your room to mount your bed, 
so once I lie there naked 
you'll unman me, strip away my courage! 
Mount your bed? Not for all the world. Not 
until you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath 
you'll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!’ 

Straightaway 

she began to swear the oath that I required—never, 
she’d never do me harm—and when she’d finished, 
then, at last, I mounted Circe’s gorgeous bed... 


At the same time her handmaids bustled through the halls, 
four in all who perform the goddess’ household tasks: 
nymphs, daughters born of the springs and groves 
and the sacred rivers running down to open sea. 

One draped the chairs with fine crimson covers 

over the seats she’d spread with linen cloths below. 

A second drew up silver tables before the chairs 

and laid out golden trays to hold the bread. 

A third mulled heady, heart-warming wine 

in a silver bowl and set out golden cups. 

A fourth brought water and lit a blazing fire 

beneath a massive cauldron. The water heated soon, 
and once it reached the boil in the glowing bronze 

she eased me into a tub and bathed me from the cauldron, 
mixing the hot and cold to suit my taste, showering 
head and shoulders down until she’d washed away 

the spirit-numbing exhaustion from my body. 

The bathing finished, rubbing me sleek with oil, 
throwing warm fleece and a shirt around my shoulders, 
she led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair, 

ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet. 

A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher

and over a silver basin tipped it out 
so I might rinse my hands, 
then pulled a gleaming table to my side. 410 
A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve me, 
appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. 
She pressed me to eat. I had no taste for food. 
I just sat there, mind wandering, far away... 
lost in grim forebodings. 
As soon as Circe saw me, 
huddled, not touching my food, immersed in sorrow, 
she sidled near with a coaxing, winged word: 
‘Odysseus, why just sit there, struck dumb, 
eating your heart out, not touching food or drink? 
Suspect me of still more treachery? Nothing to fear. 420 
Haven't I just sworn my solemn, binding oath?’ 


So she asked, but I protested, ‘Circe— 
how could any man in his right mind endure 
the taste of food and drink before he’d freed 
his comrades-in-arms and looked them in the eyes? 
If you, you really want me to eat and drink, 
set them free, all my beloved comrades— 
let me feast my eyes.’ 

So I demanded. 

Circe strode on through the halls and out, 
her wand held high in hand and, flinging open the pens, 430 
drove forth my men, who looked like full-grown swine. 
Facing her, there they stood as she went along the ranks, 
anointing them one by one with some new magic oil— 
and look, the bristles grown by the first wicked drug 
that Circe gave them slipped away from their limbs 
and they turned men again: younger than ever, 
taller by far, more handsome to the eye, and yes, 
they knew me at once and each man grasped my hands 
and a painful longing for tears overcame us all, 
a terrible sobbing echoed through the house... 440 
The goddess herself was moved and, standing by me, 
warmly urged me on—a lustrous goddess now: 


[401-32] Poon 10: THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF AEAEA 


‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, tried and true, 
go at once to your ship at the water's edge, 

haul her straight up on the shore first 

and stow your cargo and running gear in caves, 
then back you come and bring your trusty crew.’ 


Her urging won my stubborn spirit over. 
Down I went to the swift ship at the water’s edge, 
and there on the decks I found my loyal crew 
consumed with grief and weeping live warm tears. 
But now, as calves in stalls when cows come home, 
droves of them herded back from field to farmyard 
once they’ve grazed their fill—as all their young calves 
come frisking out to meet them, bucking out of their pens, 
lowing nonstop, jostling, rushing round their mothers— 
so my shipmates there at the sight of my return 
came pressing round me now, streaming tears, 
so deeply moved in their hearts they felt as if 
they’d made it back to their own land, their city, 
Ithaca’s rocky soil where they were bred and reared. 
And through their tears their words went winging home: 
‘You're back again, my king! How thrilled we are— 
as if we’d reached our country, Ithaca, at last! 
But come, tell us about the fate our comrades met.’ 


Still I replied with a timely word of comfort: 
‘Let’s haul our ship straight up on the shore first 
and stow our cargo and running gear in caves. 
Then hurry, all of you, come along with me 
to see our friends in the magic halls of Circe, 
eating and drinking—the feast flows on forever.’ 


So I said and they jumped to do my bidding. 
Only Eurylochus tried to hold my shipmates back, 
his mutinous outburst aimed at one and all: 

‘Poor fools, where are we running now? 
Why are we tempting fate?— 
why stumble blindly down to Circe’s halls? 


243

244 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


She’ll turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions 

made to guard that palace of hers—by force, I tell you— 
just as the Cyclops trapped our comrades in his lair 

with hotheaded Odysseus right beside them all— 
thanks to this man’s rashness they died too!’ 


So he declared and J had half a mind 

to draw the sharp sword from beside my hip 
and slice his head off, tumbling down in the dust, 
close kin that he was. But comrades checked me, 
each man trying to calm me, left and right: 
‘Captain, we'll leave him here if you command, 
just where he is, to sit and guard the ship. 
Lead us on to the magic halls of Circe.’ 

With that, 
up from the ship and shore they headed inland. 
Nor did Eurylochus malinger by the hull; 
he straggled behind the rest, 
dreading the sharp blast of my rebuke. 

All the while 
Circe had bathed my other comrades in her palace, 
caring and kindly, rubbed them sleek with oil 
and decked them out in fleecy cloaks and shirts. 
We found them all together, feasting in her halls. 
Once we had recognized each other, gazing face-to-face, 
we all broke down and wept—and the house resounded now 
and Circe the lustrous one came toward me, pleading, 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of action, 
no more tears now, calm these tides of sorrow. 
Well I know what pains you bore on the swarming sea, 
what punishment you endured from hostile men on land. 
But come now, eat your food and drink your wine 
till the same courage fills your chests, now as then, 
when you first set sail from native land, from rocky Ithaca! 
Now you are burnt-out husks, your spirits haggard, sere, 
always brooding over your wanderings long and hard, 
your hearts never lifting with any joy— 
you've suffered far too much.’

[466-96] Rees 10: THe BEWIICHING QUEEN OF AEBAEA 


So she enticed 
and won our battle-hardened spirits over. 
And there we sat at ease, 
day in, day out, till a year had run its course, 
feasting on sides of meat and drafts of heady wine... 
But then, when the year was gone and the seasons wheeled by 
and the months waned and the long days came round again, 
my loyal comrades took me aside and prodded, 
‘Captain, this is madness! 
High time you thought of your own home at last, 
if it really is your fate to make it back alive 
and reach your well-built house and native land.’ 


Their urging brought my stubborn spirit round. 
So all that day till the sun went down we sat 
and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine. 
Then when the sun had set and night came on 
the men lay down to sleep in the shadowed halls 
but I went up to that luxurious bed of Circe’s, 
hugged her by the knees 
and the goddess heard my winging supplication: 
‘Circe, now make good a promise you gave me once— 
it’s time to help me home. My heart longs to be home, 
my comrades’ hearts as well. They wear me down, 
pleading with me whenever you're away.’ 

So I pressed 

and the lustrous goddess answered me in turn: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner, 
stay on no more in my house against your will. 
But first another journey calls. You must travel down 
to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone, 
there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes, 
the great blind prophet whose mind remains unshaken. 
Even in death—Persephone has given him wisdom, 
everlasting vision to him and him alone... 
the rest of the dead are empty, flitting shades.’ 


So she said and crushed the heart inside me. 


245 


520 


530 


540 


246 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [497-529} 


I knelt in her bed and wept. I’d no desire 

to go on living and see the rising light of day. 

But once I'd had my fill of tears and writhing there, 

at last I found the words to venture, ‘Circe, Circe, 550 
who can pilot us on that journey? Who has ever 

reached the House of Death in a black ship?’ 


The lustrous goddess answered, never pausing, 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, born for exploits, 
let no lack of a pilot at the helm concern you, no, 
just step your mast and spread your white sail wide— 
sit back and the North Wind will speed you on your way. 
But once your vessel has cut across the Ocean River 
you will raise a desolate coast and Persephone’s Grove, 
her tall black poplars, willows whose fruit dies young. 560 
Beach your vessel hard by the Ocean’s churning shore 
and make your own way down to the moldering House of Death. 
And there into Acheron, the Flood of Grief, two rivers flow, 
the torrent River of Fire, the wailing River of Tears 
that branches off from Styx, the Stream of Hate, 
and a stark crag looms 
where the two rivers thunder down and meet. 
Once there, go forward, hero. Do as I say now. 
Dig a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length 
and around it pour libations out to all the dead— 570 
first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine, 
then water third and last, and sprinkle glistening barley 
over it all, and vow again and again to all the dead, 
to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts, 
that once you return to Ithaca you will slaughter 
a barren heifer in your halls, the best you have, 
and load a pyre with treasures—and to Tiresias, 
alone, apart, you will offer a sleek black ram, 
the pride of all your herds. And once your prayers 
have invoked the nations of the dead in their dim glory, 580 
slaughter a ram and a black ewe, turning both their heads 
toward Erebus, but turn your head away, looking toward 
the Ocean River. Suddenly then the countless shades 


[530-61] pom 10: THE BEWITCHING QUEEN OF AEAEA 


of the dead and gone will surge around you there. 

But order your men at once to flay the sheep 

that lie before you, killed by your ruthless blade, 

and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods, 
to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone. 

But you—draw your sharp sword from beside your hip, 
sit down on alert there, and never let the ghosts 

of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood 
till you have questioned Tiresias yourself. Soon, soon 
the great seer will appear before you, captain of armies: 
he will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage, 
how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.’ 


And with those words Dawn rose on her golden throne 
and Circe dressed me quickly in sea-cloak and shirt 
while the queen slipped on a loose, glistening robe, 
filmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist 
she ran a brocaded golden belt 
and over her head a scarf to shield her brow. 

And I strode on through the halls to stir my men, 
hovering over each with a winning word: ‘Up now! 
No more lazing away in sleep, we must set sail— 
Queen Circe has shown the way.’ 

I brought them round, 
my hardy friends-in-arms, but not even from there 
could I get them safely off without a loss... 

There was a man, Elpenor, the youngest in our ranks, 
none too brave in battle, none too sound in mind. 

He’d strayed from his mates in Circe’s magic halls 

and keen for the cool night air, 

sodden with wine he’d bedded down on her roofs. 

But roused by the shouts and tread of marching men, 
he leapt up with a start at dawn but still so dazed 

he forgot to climb back down again by the long ladder— 
headfirst from the roof he plunged, his neck snapped 
from the backbone, his soul flew down to Death. 


Once on our way, I gave the men their orders:

248 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [562-74] 


‘You think we are headed home, our own dear land? 

Well, Circe sets us a rather different course... 620 
down to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone, 

there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes.’ 


So I said, and it broke my shipmates’ hearts. 
They sank down on the ground, moaning, tore their hair. 
But it gained us nothing—what good can come of grief? 


Back to the swift ship at the water’s edge we went, 
our spirits deep in anguish, faces wet with tears. 
But Circe got to the dark hull before us, 
tethered a ram and black ewe close by— 
slipping past unseen. Who can glimpse a god 630 
who wants to be invisible gliding here and there?”

ow down we came to the ship at the water’s edge, 


we hauled and launched her into the sunlit breakers first, 
stepped the mast in the black craft and set our sail 

and loaded the sheep aboard, the ram and ewe, 

then we ourselves embarked, streaming tears, 

our hearts weighed down with anguish ... 

But Circe, the awesome nymph with lovely braids 

who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, 
yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, 
bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, 
securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back 
while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. 
The sail stretched taut as she cut the sea all day 

and the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. 


249 


250 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [13-45] 


And she made the outer limits, the Ocean River’s bounds 
where Cimmerian people have their homes—their realm and city 
shrouded in mist and cloud. The eye of the Sun can never 
flash his rays through the dark and bring them light, 
not when he climbs the starry skies or when he wheels 
back down from the heights to touch the earth once more— 20 
an endless, deadly night overhangs those wretched men. 
There, gaining that point, we beached our craft 
and herding out the sheep, we picked our way 
by the Ocean’s banks until we gained the place 
that Circe made our goal. 
Here at the spot 
Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims fast, 
and I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip, 
dug a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length 
and around it poured libations out to all the dead, 
first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine, 30 
then water third and last, and sprinkled glistening barley 
over it all, and time and again I vowed to all the dead, 
to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts, 
that once I returned to Ithaca I would slaughter 
a barren heifer in my halls, the best I had, 
and load a pyre with treasures—and to Tiresias, 
alone, apart, I would offer a sleek black ram, 
the pride of all my herds. And once my vows 
and prayers had invoked the nations of the dead, 
I took the victims, over the trench I cut their throats 40 
and the dark blood flowed in—and up out of Erebus they came, 
flocking toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone... 
Brides and unwed youths and old men who had suffered much 
and girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow 
and great armies of battle dead, stabbed by bronze spears, 
men of war still wrapped in bloody armor—thousands 
swarming around the trench from every side— 
unearthly cries—blanching terror gripped me! 
I ordered the men at once to flay the sheep 
that lay before us, killed by my ruthless blade, 50 


[45-76] BOOK 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 


and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods, 
to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone. 
But I, the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip, 
sat down on alert there and never let the ghosts 
of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood 
till I had questioned Tiresias myself. 

But first 
the ghost of Elpenor, my companion, came toward me. 
He’d not been buried under the wide ways of earth, 
not yet, we’d left his body in Circe’s house, 
unwept, unburied—this other labor pressed us. 
But I wept to see him now, pity touched my heart 
and I called out a winged word to him there: ‘Elpenor, 
how did you travel down to the world of darkness? 
Faster on foot, I see, than I in my black ship.’ 


My comrade groaned as he offered me an answer: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner, 
the doom of an angry god, and god knows how much wine— 
they were my ruin, captain .. . I'd bedded down 
on the roof of Circe’s house but never thought 
to climb back down again by the long ladder— 
headfirst from the roof I plunged, my neck snapped 
from the backbone, my soul flew down to Death. Now, 
I beg you by those you left behind, so far from here, 
your wife, your father who bred and reared you as a boy, 
and Telemachus, left at home in your halls, your only son. 
Well I know when you leave this lodging of the dead 
that you and your ship will put ashore again 
at the island of Aeaea—then and there, 
my lord, remember me, I beg you! Don’t sail off 
and desert me, left behind unwept, unburied, don’t, 
or my curse may draw god’s fury on your head. 
No, burn me in full armor, all my harness, 
heap my mound by the churning gray surf— 
a man whose luck ran out— 
sO even men to come will learn my story.

Perform my rites, and plant on my tomb that oar 
I swung with mates when I rowed among the living.’ 


‘All this, my unlucky friend,’ I reassured him, 

‘I will do for you. I won’t forget a thing.’ 

SO we sat 
and faced each other, trading our bleak parting words, 
I on my side, holding my sword above the blood, 
he across from me there, my comrade’s phantom 
dragging out his story. 

But look, the ghost 

of my mother came! My mother, dead and gone now ... 
Anticleia—daughter of that great heart Autolycus— 
whom I had left alive when I sailed for sacred Troy. 
I broke into tears to see her here, but filled with pity, 
even throbbing with grief, I would not let her ghost 
approach the blood till I had questioned Tiresias myself. 


At last he came. The shade of the famous Theban prophet, 


holding a golden scepter, knew me at once and hailed me: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits, 

man of pain, what now, what brings you here, 

forsaking the light of day 

to see this joyless kingdom of the dead? 

Stand back from the trench—put up your sharp sword 

so I can drink the blood and tell you all the truth.’ 


Moving back, I thrust my silver-studded sword 
deep in its sheath, and once he had drunk the dark blood 
the words came ringing from the prophet in his power: 
‘A sweet smooth journey home, renowned Odysseus, 
that is what you seek 
but a god will make it hard for you—I know— 
you will never escape the one who shakes the earth, 
quaking with anger at you still, still enraged 
because you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son. 
Even so, you and your crew may still reach home, 
suffering all the way, if you only have the power

to curb their wild desire and curb your own, what's more, 
from the day your good trim vessel first puts in 

at Thrinacia Island, flees the cruel blue sea. 

There you will find them grazing, 

herds and fat flocks, the cattle of Helios, 

god of the sun who sees all, hears all things. 

Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home, 
and you all may still reach Ithaca—bent with hardship, 
true—but harm them in any way, and I can see it now: 
your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well. 

And even if you escape, you'll come home late 

and come a broken man—all shipmates lost, 

alone in a stranger’s ship— 

and you will find a world of pain at home, 

crude, arrogant men devouring all your goods, 

courting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her. 

No doubt you will pay them back in blood when you come home! 
But once you have killed those suitors in your halls— 
by stealth or in open fight with slashing bronze— 

go forth once more, you must... 

carry your well-planed oar until you come 

to a race of people who know nothing of the sea, 

whose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all 

to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars, 
wings that make ships fly. And here is your sign— 
unmistakable, clear, so clear you cannot miss it: 

When another traveler falls in with you and calls 

that weight across your shoulder a fan to winnow grain, 
then plant your bladed, balanced oar in the earth 

and sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea, 
Poseidon—a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar— 
then journey home and render noble offerings up 

to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies, 

to all the gods in order. 

And at last your own death will steal upon you... 

a gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes 

to take you down, borne down with the years in ripe old age 
with all your people there in blessed peace around you.

All that I have told you will come true.’ 
‘Oh Tiresias,’ 
I replied as the prophet finished, ‘surely the gods 
have spun this out as fate, the gods themselves. 
But tell me one thing more, and tell me clearly. 
I see the ghost of my long-lost mother here before me. 
Dead, crouching close to the blood in silence, 
she cannot bear to look me in the eyes— 
her own son—or speak a word to me. How, 
lord, can I make her know me for the man I am?’ 


‘One rule there is,’ the famous seer explained, 
‘and simple for me to say and you to learn. 
Any one of the ghosts you let approach the blood 
will speak the truth to you. Anyone you refuse 
will turn and fade away.’ 
And with those words, 
now that his prophecies had closed, the awesome shade 
of lord Tiresias strode back to the House of Death. 
But I kept watch there, steadfast till my mother 
approached and drank the dark, clouding blood. 
She knew me at once and wailed out in grief 
and her words came winging toward me, flying home: 
‘Oh my son—what brings you down to the world 
of death and darkness? You are still alive! 
It’s hard for the living to catch a glimpse of this... 
Great rivers flow between us, terrible waters, 
the Ocean first of all—no one could ever ford 
that stream on foot, only aboard some sturdy craft. 
Have you just come from Troy, wandering long years 
with your men and ship? Not yet returned to Ithaca? 
You've still not seen your wife inside your halls?’ 
‘Mother,’ 
I replied, ‘I had to venture down to the House of Death, 
to consult the shade of Tiresias, seer of Thebes. 
Never yet have I neared Achaea, never once 
set foot on native ground, 
always wandering—endless hardship from that day

I first set sail with King Agamemnon bound for Troy, 
the stallion-land, to fight the Trojans there. 
But tell me about yourself and spare me nothing. 
What form of death overcame you, what laid you low, 
some long slow illness? Or did Artemis showering arrows 
come with her painless shafts and bring you down? 
Tell me of father, tell of the son I left behind: 
do my royal rights still lie in their safekeeping? 
Or does some stranger hold the throne by now 
because men think that I’ll come home no more? 
Please, tell me about my wife, her turn of mind, 
her thoughts . . . still standing fast beside our son, 
still guarding our great estates, secure as ever now? 
Or has she wed some other countryman at last, 
the finest prince among them?’ 

‘Surely, surely,’ 
my noble mother answered quickly, ‘she’s still waiting 
there in your halls, poor woman, suffering so, 
her life an endless hardship like your own... 
wasting away the nights, weeping away the days. 
No one has taken over your royal rights, not yet. 
Telemachus still holds your great estates in peace, 
he attends the public banquets shared with all, 
the feasts a man of justice should enjoy, 
for every lord invites him. As for your father, 
he keeps to his own farm—he never goes to town— 
with no bed for him there, no blankets, glossy throws; 
all winter long he sleeps in the lodge with servants, 
in the ashes by the fire, his body wrapped in rags. 
But when summer comes and the bumper crops of harvest, 
any spot on the rising ground of his vineyard rows 
he makes his bed, heaped high with fallen leaves, 
and there he lies in anguish... 
with his old age bearing hard upon him, too, 
and his grief grows as he longs for your return. 
And I with the same grief, I died and met my fate. 
No sharp-eyed Huntress showering arrows through the halls 
approached and brought me down with painless shafts,

nor did some hateful illness strike me, that so often 

devastates the body, drains our limbs of power. 

No, it was my longing for you, my shining Odysseus— 230 
you and your quickness, you and your gentle ways— 

that tore away my life that had been sweet.’ 


And I, my mind in turmoil, how I longed 
to embrace my mother’s spirit, dead as she was! 
Three times I rushed toward her, desperate to hold her, 
three times she fluttered through my fingers, sifting away 
like a shadow, dissolving like a dream, and each time 
the grief cut to the heart, sharper, yes, and I, 
I cried out to her, words winging into the darkness: 
‘Mother—why not wait for me? How I long to hold you!— 240 
so even here, in the House of Death, we can fling 
our loving arms around each other, take some joy 
in the tears that numb the heart. Or is this just 
some wraith that great Persephone sends my way 
to make me ache with sorrow all the more?’ 


My noble mother answered me at once: 
‘My son, my son, the unluckiest man alive! 
This is no deception sent by Queen Persephone, 
this is just the way of mortals when we die. 
Sinews no longer bind the flesh and bones together— 250 
the fire in all its fury burns the body down to ashes 
once life slips from the white bones, and the spirit, 
rustling, flitters away . .. flown like a dream. 
But you must long for the daylight. Go, quickly. 
Remember all these things 
so one day you can tell them to your wife.’ 


And so we both confided, trading parting words, 
and there slowly came a grand array of women, 
all sent before me now by august Persephone, 
and all were wives and daughters once of princes. 260 
They swarmed in a flock around the dark blood 
while I searched for a way to question each alone,

and the more I thought, the more this seemed the best: 
Drawing forth the long sharp sword from beside my hip, 
I would not let them drink the dark blood, all in a rush, 
and so they waited, coming forward one after another. 
Each declared her lineage, and I explored them all. 


And the first I saw there? Tyro, born of kings, 
who said her father was that great lord Salmoneus, 
said that she was the wife of Cretheus, Aeolus’ son. 
And once she fell in love with the river god, Enipeus, 
far the clearest river flowing across the earth, 
and so she’d haunt Enipeus’ glinting streams, 
till taking his shape one day 
the god who girds the earth and makes it tremble 
bedded her where the swirling river rushes out to sea, 
and a surging wave reared up, high as a mountain, dark, 
arching over to hide the god and mortal girl together. 
Loosing her virgin belt, he lapped her round in sleep 
and when the god had consummated his work of love 
he took her by the hand and hailed her warmly: 
‘Rejoice in our love, my lady! And when this year 
has run its course you will give birth to glorious children— 
bedding down with the gods is never barren, futile— 
and you must tend them, breed and rear them well. 
Now home you go, and restrain yourself, I say, 
never breathe your lover’s name but know— 
I am Poseidon, god who rocks the earth!’ 


With that he dove back in the heaving waves 
and she conceived for the god and bore him Pelias, Neleus, 
and both grew up to be stalwart aides of Zeus almighty, 
both men alike. Pelias lived on the plains of Iolcos, 
rich in sheepflocks, Neleus lived in sandy Pylos. 
And the noble queen bore sons to Cretheus too: 
Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon, exultant charioteer. 


And after Tyro I saw Asopus’ daughter Antiope, 
proud she’d spent a night in the arms of Zeus himself 


257 


270 


280 


290

and borne the god twin sons, Amphion and Zethus, 

the first to build the footings of seven-gated Thebes, 

her bastions too, for lacking ramparts none could live 300 
in a place so vast, so open—strong as both men were. 


And I saw Alcmena next, Amphitryon’s wife, 
who slept in the clasp of Zeus and merged in love 
and brought forth Heracles, rugged will and lion heart. 
And I saw Megara too, magnanimous Creon’s daughter 
wed to the stalwart Heracles, the hero never daunted. 


And I saw the mother of Oedipus, beautiful Epicaste. 
What a monstrous thing she did, in all innocence— 
she married her own son... 
who'd killed his father, then he married her! 310 
But the gods soon made it known to all mankind. 
So he in growing pain ruled on in beloved Thebes, 
lording Cadmus’ people—thanks to the gods’ brutal plan— 
while she went down to Death who guards the massive gates. 
Lashing a noose to a steep rafter, there she hanged aloft, 
strangling in all her anguish, leaving her son to bear 
the world of horror a mother’s Furies bring to life. 


And I saw magnificent Chloris, the one whom Neleus 
wooed and won with a hoard of splendid gifts, 
so dazzled by her beauty years ago... 320 
the youngest daughter of Iasus’ son Amphion, 
the great Minyan king who ruled Orchomenos once. 
She was his queen in Pylos, she bore him shining sons, 
Nestor and Chromius, Periclymenus too, good prince. 
And after her sons she bore a daughter, majestic Pero, 
the marvel of her time, courted by all the young lords 
round about. But Neleus would not give her to any suitor,, 
none but the man who might drive home the herds 
that powerful Iphiclus had stolen. Lurching, 
broad in the brow, those longhorned beasts, 330 
and no small task to round them up from Phylace. 


[291-322] mookK ll: DRE KINGDOM OFTHE DEAD 


Only the valiant seer Melampus volunteered— 

he would drive them home— 

but a god’s iron sentence bound him fast: 

barbarous herdsmen dragged him off in chains. 

Yet when the months and days had run their course 

and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again, 
then mighty Iphiclus loosed the prophet’s shackles, 

once he had told him all the gods’ decrees. 

And so the will of Zeus was done at last. 


And I saw Leda next, Tyndareus’ wife, 
who’d borne the king two sons, intrepid twins, 
Castor, breaker of horses, and the hardy boxer Polydeuces, 
both buried now in the life-giving earth though still alive. 
Even under the earth Zeus grants them that distinction: 
one day alive, the next day dead, each twin by turns, 
they both hold honors equal to the gods’. 


And I saw Iphimedeia next, Aloeus’ wife, 
who claimed she lay in the Sea-lord’s loving waves 
and gave the god two sons, but they did not live long, 
Otus staunch as a god and far-famed Ephialtes. 
They were the tallest men the fertile earth has borne, 
the handsomest too, by far, aside from renowned Orion. 
Nine yards across they measured, even at nine years old, 
nine fathoms tall they towered. They even threatened 
the deathless gods they’d storm Olympus’ heights 
with the pounding rush and grinding shock of battle. 
They were wild to pile Ossa upon Olympus, then on Ossa 
Pelion dense with timber—their toeholds up the heavens. 
And they’d have won the day if they had reached peak strength 
but Apollo the son of Zeus, whom sleek-haired Leto bore, 
laid both giants low before their beards had sprouted, 
covering cheek and chin with a fresh crop of down. 


Phaedra and Procris too I saw, and lovely Ariadne, 
daughter of Minos, that harsh king. One day Theseus tried 


259 


340 


350 


360 


260 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [323-52] 


to spirit her off from Crete to Athens’ sacred heights 
but he got no joy from her. Artemis killed her first 
on wave-washed Dia’s shores, accused by Dionysus. 


And I saw Clymene, Maera and loathsome Eriphyle 
bribed with a golden necklace 370 
to lure her lawful husband to his death... 

But the whole cortege I could never tally, never name, 
not all the daughters and wives of great men I saw there. 
Long before that, the godsent night would ebb away. 
But the time has come for sleep, either with friends 
aboard your swift ship or here in your own house. 

My passage home will rest with the gods and you.” 


Odysseus paused .. . They all fell silent, hushed, 
his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls 
till the white-armed queen Arete suddenly burst out, 380 
“Phaeacians! How does this man impress you now, 
his looks, his build, the balanced mind inside him? 
The stranger is my guest 
but each of you princes shares the honor here. 
So let’s not be too hasty to send him on his way, 
and don’t scrimp on his gifts. His need is great, 
great as the riches piled up in your houses, 
thanks to the gods’ good will.” 

Following her, 
the old revered Echeneus added his support, 
the eldest lord on the island of Phaeacia: 390 
“Friends, the words of our considerate queen— 
they never miss the mark or fail our expectations. 
So do as Arete says, though on Alcinous here 
depend all words and action.” 
“And so it will be’ — 

Alcinous stepped in grandly—“sure as I am alive 
and rule our island men who love their oars! 
Our guest, much as he longs for passage home, 
must stay and wait it out here till tomorrow, 
till I can collect his whole array of parting gifts. 


[352-83] Boon. 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 


His send-off rests with every noble here 
but with me most of all: 
I hold the reins of power in the realm.” 


Odysseus, deft and tactful, echoed back, 
“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, 
if you would urge me now to stay here one whole year 
then speed me home weighed down with lordly gifts, 
I'd gladly have it so. Better by far, that way. 
The fuller my arms on landing there at home, 
the more respected, well received I’d be 
by all who saw me sailing back to Ithaca.” 


“Ah Odysseus,” Alcinous replied, “one look at you 
and we know that you are no one who would cheat us— 
no fraud, such as the dark soil breeds and spreads 
across the face of the earth these days. Crowds of vagabonds 
frame their lies so tightly none can test them. But you, 
what grace you give your words, and what good sense within! 
You have told your story with all a singer’s skill, 
the miseries you endured, your great Achaeans too. 
But come now, tell me truly: your godlike comrades— 
did you see any heroes down in the House of Death, 
any who sailed with you and met their doom at Troy? 
The night’s still young, I’d say the night is endless. 
For us in the palace now, it’s hardly time for sleep. 
Keep telling us your adventures—they are wonderful. 
I could hold out here till Dawn’s first light 
if only you could bear, here in our halls, 
to tell the tale of all the pains you suffered.” 


So the man of countless exploits carried on: 
“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, 
there is a time for many words, a time for sleep as well. 
But if you insist on hearing more, I’d never stint 
on telling my own tale and those more painful still, 
the griefs of my comrades, dead in the war’s wake, 
who escaped the battle-cries of Trojan armies

only to die in blood at journey’s end— 
thanks to a vicious woman’s will. 
Now then, 
no sooner had Queen Persephone driven off 
the ghosts of lovely women, scattering left and right, 
than forward marched the shade of Atreus’ son Agamemnon, 
fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades, 440 
troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him, 
who met their fate in lord Aegisthus’ halls. 
He knew me at once, as soon as he drank the blood, 
and wailed out, shrilly; tears sprang to his eyes, 
he thrust his arms toward me, keen to embrace me there— 
no use—the great force was gone, the strength lost forever, 
now, that filled his rippling limbs in the old days. 
I wept at the sight, my heart went out to the man, 
my words too, in a winging flight of pity: 
‘Famous Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon! 450 
What fatal stroke of destiny brought you down? 
Wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused 
some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust? 
Or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land 
as you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks 
or fought to win their city, take their women?’ 


The field marshal’s ghost replied at once: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, mastermind of war, 
I was not wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon 
roused some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust, 460 
nor did ranks of enemies mow me down on land— 
Aegisthus hatched my doom and my destruction, 
he killed me, he with my own accursed wife... 
he invited me to his palace, sat me down to feast 
then cut me down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough! 
So I died—a wretched, ignominious death—and round me 
all my comrades killed, no mercy, one after another, 
just like white-tusked boars 
butchered in some rich lord of power’s halls 


[415-44] BOOK 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 263 


for a wedding, banquet or groaning public feast. 470 
You in your day have witnessed hundreds slaughtered, 
killed in single combat or killed in pitched battle, true, 
but if you’d laid eyes on this it would have wrenched your heart— 
how we sprawled by the mixing-bowl and loaded tables there, 
throughout the palace, the whole floor awash with blood. 
But the death-cry of Cassandra, Priam’s daughter— 
the most pitiful thing I heard! My treacherous queen, 
Clytemnestra, killed her over my body, yes, and I, 
lifting my fists, beat them down on the ground, 
dying, dying, writhing around the sword. | 480 
But she, that whore, she turned her back on me, 
well on my way to Death—she even lacked the heart 
to seal my eyes with her hand or close my jaws. 
So; 
there’s nothing more deadly, bestial than a woman 
set on works like these—what a monstrous thing 
she plotted, slaughtered her own lawful husband! 
Why, I expected, at least, some welcome home 
from all my children, all my household slaves 
when I came sailing back again . . . But she— 
the queen hell-bent on outrage—bathes in shame 490 
not only herself but the whole breed of womankind, 
even the honest ones to come, forever down the years!’ 


So he declared and I cried out, ‘How terrible! 
Zeus from the very start, the thunder king 
has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance— 
his trustiest weapon women’s twisted wiles. 
What armies of us died for the sake of Helen... 
Clytemnestra schemed your death while you were worlds away!’ 


‘True, true,’ Agamemnon’s ghost kept pressing on, 
‘so even your own wife—never indulge her too far. 500 
Never reveal the whole truth, whatever you may know; 
just tell her a part of it, be sure to hide the rest. 
Not that you, Odysseus, will be murdered by your wife. 


264 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [445-74] 


She’s much too steady, her feelings run too deep, 
Icarius’ daughter Penelope, that wise woman. 

She was a young bride, I well remember... 

we left her behind when we went off to war, 

with an infant boy she nestled at her breast. 

That boy must sit and be counted with the men now— 
happy man! His beloved father will come sailing home 510 
and see his son, and he will embrace his father, 

that is only right. But my wife—she never 

even let me feast my eyes on my own son; 

she killed me first, his father! 

I tell you this—bear it in mind, you must— 

when you reach your homeland steer your ship 

into port in secret, never out in the open... 

the time for trusting women’s gone forever! 


Enough. Come, tell me this, and be precise. 
Have you heard news of my son? Where’s he living now? 520 
Perhaps in Orchomenos, perhaps in sandy Pylos 
or off in the Spartan plains with Menelaus? 
He’s not dead yet, my Prince Orestes, no, 
he’s somewhere on the earth.’ 

So he probed 

but I cut it short: ‘Atrides, why ask me that? 
I know nothing, whether he’s dead or alive. 
It’s wrong to lead you on with idle words.’ 


So we stood there, trading heartsick stories, 
deep in grief, as the tears streamed down our faces. 
But now there came the ghosts of Peleus’ son Achilles, 530 
Patroclus, fearless Antilochus—and Great Ajax too, 
the first in stature, first in build and bearing 
of all the Argives after Peleus’ matchless son. 
The ghost of the splendid runner knew me at once 
and hailed me with a flight of mournful questions: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of tactics, 
reckless friend, what next? 


[474-502] BOOK 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 265 


What greater feat can that cunning head contrive? 
What daring brought you down to the House of Death?— 
where the senseless, burnt-out wraiths of mortals make their home.’ 540 


The voice of his spirit paused, and I was quick to answer: 
‘Achilles, son of Peleus, greatest of the Achaeans, 
I had to consult Tiresias, driven here by hopes 
he would help me journey home to rocky Ithaca. 
Never yet have I neared Achaea, never once 
set foot on native ground... 
my life is endless trouble. 
But you, Achilles, 
there’s not a man in the world more blest than you— 
there never has been, never will be one. 
Time was, when you were alive, we Argives 550 
honored you as a god, and now down here, I see, 
you lord it over the dead in all your power. 
So grieve no more at dying, great Achilles.’ 


I reassured the ghost, but he broke out, protesting, 
‘No winning words about death to me, shining Odysseus! 
By god, I’d rather slave on earth for another man— 
some dirt-poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive— 
than rule down here over all the breathless dead. 
But come, tell me the news about my gallant son. 
Did he make his way to the wars, 560 
did the boy become a champion—yes or no? 
Tell me of noble Peleus, any word you’ve heard— 
still holding pride of place among his Myrmidon hordes, 
or do they despise the man in Hellas and in Phthia 
because old age has lamed his arms and legs? 
For I no longer stand in the light of day— 
the man I was—comrade-in-arms to help my father 
as once I helped our armies, killing the best fighters 
Troy could field in the wide world up there... 
Oh to arrive at father’s house—the man I was, 570 
for one brief day—I’d make my fury and my hands, 


266 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


invincible hands, a thing of terror to all those men 


who abuse the king with force and wrest away his honor!’ 


So he grieved but I tried to lend him heart: 
‘About noble Peleus I can tell you nothing, 
but about your own dear son, Neoptolemus, 
I can report the whole story, as you wish. 
I myself, in my trim ship, I brought him 
out of Scyros to join the Argives under arms. 
And dug in around Troy, debating battle-tactics, 
he always spoke up first, and always on the mark— 
godlike Nestor and I alone excelled the boy. Yes, 
and when our armies fought on the plain of Troy 
he’d never hang back with the main force of men— 
he’d always charge ahead, 
giving ground to no one in his fury, 
and scores of men he killed in bloody combat. 
How could I list them all, name them all, now, 


the fighting ranks he leveled, battling for the Argives? 


But what a soldier he laid low with a bronze sword: 
the hero Eurypylus, Telephus’ son, and round him 
troops of his own Cetean comrades slaughtered, 
lured to war by the bribe his mother took. 

The only man I saw to put Eurypylus 

in the shade was Memnon, son of the Morning. 


Again, when our champions climbed inside the horse 


that Epeus built with labor, and I held full command 
to spring our packed ambush open or keep it sealed, 


all our lords and captains were wiping off their tears, 
knees shaking beneath each man—but not your son. 


Never once did I see his glowing skin go pale; 
he never flicked a tear from his cheeks, no, 

he kept on begging me there to let him burst 
from the horse, kept gripping his hilted sword, 
his heavy bronze-tipped javelin, keen to loose 
his fighting fury against the Trojans. Then, 
once we'd sacked King Priam’s craggy city, 
laden with his fair share and princely prize 


[502-34] 


580 


590 


600 


[534-63] BOOK 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 267 


he boarded his own ship, his body all unscarred. 
Not a wound from a flying spear or a sharp sword, 610 
cut-and-thrust close up—the common marks of war. 
Random, raging Ares plays no favorites.’ 
So I said and 
off he went, the ghost of the great runner, Aeacus’ grandson 
loping with long strides across the fields of asphodel, 
triumphant in all I had told him of his son, 
his gallant, glorious son. 


Now the rest of the ghosts, the dead and gone 
came swarming up around me—deep in sorrow there, 
each asking about the grief that touched him most. 
Only the ghost of Great Ajax, son of Telamon, 620 
kept his distance, blazing with anger at me still 
for the victory I had won by the ships that time 
I pressed my claim for the arms of Prince Achilles. 
His queenly mother had set them up as prizes, 
Pallas and captive Trojans served as judges. 
Would to god I’d never won such trophies! 
All for them the earth closed over Ajax, 
that proud hero Ajax... 
greatest in build, greatest in works of war 
of all the Argives after Peleus’ matchless son. 630 
I cried out to him now, I tried to win him over: 
‘Ajax, son of noble Telamon, still determined, 
even in death, not once to forget that rage 
you train on me for those accursed arms? 
The gods set up that prize to plague the Achaeans— 
sO great a tower of strength we lost when you went down! 
For your death we grieved as we did for Achilles’ death— 
we grieved incessantly, true, and none’s to blame 
but Zeus, who hated Achaea’s fighting spearmen 
so intensely, Zeus sealed your doom. 640 
Come closer, king, and listen to my story. 
Conquer your rage, your blazing, headstrong pride!’ 


So I cried out but Ajax answered not a word. 


268 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [563-89] 


He stalked off toward Erebus, into the dark 

to join the other lost, departed dead. 

Yet now, despite his anger, 

he might have spoken to me, or I to him, 

but the heart inside me stirred with some desire 
to see the ghosts of others dead and gone. 


And I saw Minos there, illustrious son of Zeus, 650 
firmly enthroned, holding his golden scepter, 
judging all the dead... 
Some on their feet, some seated, all clustering 
round the king of justice, pleading for his verdicts 
reached in the House of Death with its all-embracing gates. 


I next caught sight of Orion, that huge hunter, 
rounding up on the fields of asphodel those wild beasts 
the man in life cut down on the lonely mountain-slopes, 
brandishing in his hands the bronze-studded club 
that time can never shatter. 

I saw Tityus too, 660 

son of the mighty goddess Earth—sprawling there 
on the ground, spread over nine acres—two vultures 
hunched on either side of him, digging into his liver, 
beaking deep in the blood-sac, and he with his frantic hands 
could never beat them off, for he had once dragged off 
the famous consort of Zeus in all her glory, 
Leto, threading her way toward Pytho’s ridge, 
over the lovely dancing-rings of Panopeus. 


And I saw Tantalus too, bearing endless torture. 
He stood erect in a pool as the water lapped his chin— 670 
parched, he tried to drink, but he could not reach the surface, 
no, time and again the old man stooped, craving a sip, 
time and again the water vanished, swallowed down, 
laying bare the caked black earth at his feet— 
some spirit drank it dry. And over his head 
leafy trees dangled their fruit from high aloft, 
pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red, 


[590-622] BOOK 11: THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD 269 


succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark, 
but as soon as the old man would strain to clutch them fast 
a gust would toss them up to the lowering dark clouds. 680 


And I saw Sisyphus too, bound to his own torture, 
grappling his monstrous boulder with both arms working, 
heaving, hands struggling, legs driving, he kept on 
thrusting the rock uphill toward the brink, but just 
as it teetered, set to topple over— 

time and again 

the immense weight of the thing would wheel it back and 
the ruthless boulder would bound and tumble down to the plain again— 
so once again he would heave, would struggle to thrust it up, 
sweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head. 


And next I caught a glimpse of powerful Heracles— 690 
his ghost, I mean: the man himself delights 
in the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high, 
wed to Hebe, famed for her lithe, alluring ankles, 
the daughter of mighty Zeus and Hera shod in gold. 
Around him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds, 
scattering left and right in horror as on he came like night, 
naked bow in his grip, an arrow grooved on the bowstring, 
glaring round him fiercely, forever poised to shoot. 
A terror too, that sword-belt sweeping across his chest, 
a baldric of solid gold emblazoned with awesome work .. . 700 
bears and ramping boars and lions with wild, fiery eyes, 
and wars, routs and battles, massacres, butchered men. 
May the craftsman who forged that masterpiece— 
whose skills could conjure up a belt like that— 
never forge another! 
Heracles knew me at once, at first glance, 
and hailed me with a winging burst of pity: 
‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus famed for exploits, 
luckless man, you too? Braving out a fate as harsh 
as the fate I bore, alive in the light of day? 710 
Son of Zeus that I was, my torments never ended, 
forced to slave for a man not half the man I was: 


270 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


he saddled me with the worst heartbreaking labors. 

Why, he sent me down here once, to retrieve the hound 

that guards the dead—no harder task for me, he thought— 
but I dragged the great beast up from the underworld to earth 
and Hermes and gleaming-eyed Athena blazed the way!’ 


With that he turned and back he went to the House of Death 
but I held fast in place, hoping that others might still come, 
shades of famous heroes, men who died in the old days 
and ghosts of an even older age I longed to see, 

Theseus and Pirithous, the gods’ own radiant sons. 

But before I could, the dead came surging round me, 
hordes of them, thousands raising unearthly cries, 

and blanching terror gripped me—panicked now 

that Queen Persephone might send up from Death 

some monstrous head, some Gorgon’s staring face! 

I rushed back to my ship, commanded all hands 

to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly. 

They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks 
and a strong tide of the Ocean River swept her on downstream, 
sped by our rowing first, then by a fresh fair wind.”

ow when our ship had left the Ocean River rolling in her wake 


and launched out into open sea with its long swells to reach 
the island of Aeaea—east where the Dawn forever young 
has home and dancing-rings and the Sun his risings— 
heading in we beached our craft on the sands, 

the crews swung out on the low sloping shore 

and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn’s first light. 


As soon as Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone again 
I dispatched some men to Circe’s halls to bring 
the dead Elpenor’s body. We cut logs in haste 10 
and out on the island’s sharpest jutting headland 
held his funeral rites in sorrow, streaming tears. 
Once we’d burned the dead man and the dead man’s armor, 
heaping his grave-mound, hauling a stone that coped it well, 


el 


EE Oeeererleleleee ee 
AZ HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [15-44] 


we planted his balanced var aloft to crown his tomb. 


And so we saw to his rites, each step in turn. 
Nor did our coming back from Death escape Circe— 
she hurried toward us, decked in rich regalia, 
handmaids following close with trays of bread 
and meats galore and glinting ruddy wine. 20 
And the lustrous goddess, standing in our midst, 
hailed us warmly: ‘Ah my daring, reckless friends! 
You who ventured down to the House of Death alive, 
doomed to die twice over—others die just once. 
Come, take some food and drink some wine, 
rest here the livelong day 
and then, tomorrow at daybreak, you must sail. 
But I will set you a course and chart each seamark, 
so neither on sea nor land will some new trap 
ensnare you in trouble, make you suffer more.’ 30 


Her foresight won our fighting spirits over. 
So all that day till the sun went down we sat 
and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine, 
and then when the sun had set and night came on 
the men lay down to sleep by the ship’s stern-cables. 
But Circe, taking me by the hand, drew me away 
from all my shipmates there and sat me down 
and lying beside me probed me for details. 
I told her the whole story, start to finish, 
then the queenly goddess laid my course: 40 
‘Your descent to the dead is over, true, 
but listen closely to what I tell you now 
and god himself will bring it back to mind. 
First you will raise the island of the Sirens, 
those creatures who spellbind any man alive, 
whoever comes their way. Whoever draws too close, 
off guard, and catches the Sirens’ voices in the air— 
no sailing home for him, no wife rising to meet him, 
no happy children beaming up at their father’s face. 
The high, thrilling song of the Sirens will transfix him, 50 


[45-77] HOOK 12: THESCATTLE OF THE SUN 273 


lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses 

rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones... 

Race straight past that coast! Soften some beeswax 

and stop your shipmates’ ears so none can hear, 

none of the crew, but if you are bent on hearing, 

have them tie you hand and foot in the swift ship, 

erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast 

so you can hear the Sirens’ song to your heart’s content. 

But if you plead, commanding your men to set you free, 

then they must lash you faster, rope on rope. 60 


But once your crew has rowed you past the Sirens 
a choice of routes is yours. I cannot advise you 
which to take, or lead you through it all— 
you must decide for yourself— 
but I can tell you the ways of either course. 
On one side beetling cliffs shoot up, and against them 
pound the huge roaring breakers of blue-eyed Amphitrite— 
the Clashing Rocks they’re called by all the blissful gods. 
Not even birds can escape them, no, not even the doves 
that veer and fly ambrosia home to Father Zeus: 70 
even of those the sheer Rocks always pick off one 
and Father wings one more to keep the number up. 
No ship of men has ever approached and slipped past— 
always some disaster—big timbers and sailors’ corpses 
whirled away by the waves and lethal blasts of fire. 
One ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear, 
the Argo, sung by the world, when heading home 
from Aeetes’ shores. And she would have crashed 
against those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera, 
for love of Jason, had not sped her through. 80 


On the other side loom two enormous crags... . 
One thrusts into the vaulting sky its jagged peak, 
hooded round with a dark cloud that never leaves— 
no clear bright air can ever bathe its crown, 
not even in summer’s heat or harvest-time. 

No man on earth could scale it, mount its crest, 


eS 


274 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [78-112] 


not even with twenty hands and twenty feet for climbing, 

the rock’s so smooth, like dressed and burnished stone. 

And halfway up that cliffside stands a fog-bound cavern 

gaping west toward Erebus, realm of death and darkness— 90 
past it, great Odysseus, you should steer your ship. 

No rugged young archer could hit that yawning cave 

with a winged arrow shot from off the decks. 

Scylla lurks inside it—the yelping horror, 

yelping, no louder than any suckling pup 

but she’s a grisly monster, I assure you. 

No one could look on her with any joy, 

not even a god who meets her face-to-face .. . 

She has twelve legs, all writhing, dangling down 

and six long swaying necks, a hideous head on each, 100 
each head barbed with a triple row of fangs, thickset, 

packed tight—and armed to the hilt with black death! 

Holed up in the cavern’s bowels from her waist down 

she shoots out her heads, out of that terrifying pit, 

angling right from her nest, wildly sweeping the reefs 

for dolphins, dogfish or any bigger quarry she can drag 

from the thousands Amphitrite spawns in groaning seas. 

No mariners yet can boast they’ve raced their ship 

past Scylla’s lair without some mortal blow— 

with each of her six heads she snatches up 110 
a man from the dark-prowed craft and whisks him off. 


The other crag is lower—you will see, Odysseus— 
though both lie side-by-side, an arrow-shot apart. 
Atop it a great fig-tree rises, shaggy with leaves, 
beneath it awesome Charybdis gulps the dark water down. 
Three times a day she vomits it up, three times she gulps it down, 
that terror! Don’t be there when the whirlpool swallows down— 
not even the earthquake god could save you from disaster. 
No, hug Scylla’s crag—sail on past her—top speed! 
Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship 120 
than lose your entire crew.’ 

"Ves; «yes; 

but tell me the truth now, goddess,’ I protested. 


[113-45] BIQOK 12: THE CATTLE OF THE SUN 275 


‘Deadly Charybdis—can’t I possibly cut and run from her 
and still fight Scylla off when Scylla strikes my men?’ 


‘So stubborn!’ the lovely goddess countered. 
‘Hell-bent yet again on battle and feats of arms? 
Can’t you bow to the deathless gods themselves? 
Scylla’s no mortal, she’s an immortal devastation, 
terrible, savage, wild, no fighting her, no defense— 
just flee the creature, that’s the only way. 130 
Waste any time, arming for battle beside her rock, 

I fear she'll lunge out again with all of her six heads 
and seize as many men. No, row for your lives, 
invoke Brute Force, I tell you, Scylla’s mother— 
she spawned her to scourge mankind, 

she can stop the monster’s next attack! 


Then you will make the island of Thrinacia.. . 
where herds of the Sungod’s cattle graze, and fat sheep 
and seven herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, rich and woolly, 
fifty head in each. No breeding swells their number, 140 
nor do they ever die. And goddesses herd them on, 
nymphs with glinting hair, Phaéthusa, Lampetie, 
born to the Sungod Helios by radiant Neaera. 
Their queenly mother bred and reared them both 
then settled them on the island of Thrinacia— 
their homeland seas away— 
to guard their father’s sheep and longhorn cattle. 
Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home, 
and you all may still reach Ithaca—bent with hardship, 
true—but harm them in any way, and I can see it now: 150 
your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well! 
And even if you escape, you'll come home late, 
all shipmates lost, and come a broken man.’ 


At those words Dawn rose on her golden throne 
and lustrous Circe made her way back up the island. 
I went straight to my ship, commanding all hands 
to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly. 


276 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [140-78] 


They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks 

and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. 
And Circe the nymph with glossy braids, the awesome one 160 
who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, 

yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, 

bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, 

securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back 

while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. 

At last, and sore at heart, I told my shipmates, 

‘Friends .. . it’s wrong for only one or two 

to know the revelations that lovely Circe 

made to me alone. I'll tell you all, 

so we can die with our eyes wide open now 170 
or escape our fate and certain death together. 

First, she warns, we must steer clear of the Sirens, 

their enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers. 

I alone was to hear their voices, so she said, 

but you must bind me with tight chafing ropes 

so I cannot move a muscle, bound to the spot, 

erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast. 

And if I plead, commanding you to set me free, 

then lash me faster, rope,on pressing rope.’ 


So I informed my shipmates point by point, 180 
all the while our trim ship was speeding toward 
the Sirens’ island, driven on by the brisk wind. 
But then—the wind fell in an instant, 
all glazed to a dead calm... 
a mysterious power hushed the heaving swells. 
The oarsmen leapt to their feet, struck the sail, 
stowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks, 
thrashing with polished oars, frothing the water white. . 
Now with a sharp sword I sliced an ample wheel of beeswax 
down into pieces, kneaded them in my two strong hands 190 
and the wax soon grew soft, worked by my strength 
and Helios’ burning rays, the sun at high noon, 
and I stopped the ears of my comrades one by one. 
They bound me hand and foot in the tight ship— 


[179-212] BOOK 12: THE CATTLE OF THE SUN a7 


erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast— 

and rowed and churned the whitecaps stroke on stroke. 

We were just offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry, 

scudding close, when the Sirens sensed at once a ship 

was racing past and burst into their high, thrilling song: 

‘Come closer, famous Odysseus—Achaea’s pride and glory— 200 
moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song! 

Never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft 

until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips, 

and once he hears to his heart’s content sails on, a wiser man. 
We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured 
on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so— 

all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!’ 


So they sent their ravishing voices out across the air 
and the heart inside me throbbed to listen longer. 
I signaled the crew with frowns to set me free— 210 
they flung themselves at the oars and rowed on harder, 
Perimedes and Eurylochus springing up at once 
to bind me faster with rope on chafing rope. 
But once we'd left the Sirens fading in our wake, 
once we could hear their song no more, their urgent call— 
my steadfast crew was quick to remove the wax I’d used 
to seal their ears and loosed the bonds that lashed me. 


We'd scarcely put that island astern when suddenly 
I saw smoke and heavy breakers, heard their booming thunder. 
The men were terrified—oarblades flew from their grip, 220 
clattering down to splash in the vessel’s wash. 
She lay there, dead in the water... 
no hands to tug the blades that drove her on. 
But I strode down the decks to rouse my crewmen, 
halting beside each one with a bracing, winning word: 
‘Friends, we’re hardly strangers at meeting danger— 
and this danger is no worse than what we faced 
when Cyclops penned us up in his vaulted cave 
with crushing force! But even from there my courage, 
my presence of mind and tactics saved us all, 230 


278 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [212~46} 


and we will live to remember this someday, 

I have no doubt. Up now, follow my orders, 

all of us work as one! You men at the thwarts— 

lay on with your oars and strike the heaving swells, 

trusting that Zeus will pull us through these straits alive. 

You, helmsman, here’s your order—burn it in your mind— 

the steering-oar of our rolling ship is in your hands. 

Keep her clear of that smoke and surging breakers, 

head for those crags or she'll catch you off guard, 

she’ll yaw over there—you'll plunge us all in ruin!’ 240 


So I shouted. They snapped to each command. 
No mention of Scylla—how to fight that nightmare?— 
for fear the men would panic, desert their oars 
and huddle down and stow themselves away. 
But now I cleared my mind of Circe’s orders— 
cramping my style, urging me not to arm at all. 
I donned my heroic armor, seized long spears 
in both my hands and marched out on the half-deck, 
forward, hoping from there to catch the first glimpse 
of Scylla, ghoul of the cliffs, swooping to kill my men. 250 
But nowhere could I make her out—and my eyes ached, 
scanning that mist-bound rock face top to bottom. 


Now wailing in fear, we rowed on up those straits, 
Scylla to starboard, dreaded Charybdis off to port, 
her horrible whirlpool gulping the sea-surge down, down 
but when she spewed it up—like a cauldron over a raging fire— 
all her churning depths would seethe and heave—exploding spray 
showering down to splatter the peaks of both crags at once! 
But when she swallowed the sea-surge down her gaping maw 
the whole abyss lay bare and the rocks around her roared, 260 
terrible, deafening— ' 

bedrock showed down deep, boiling 
black with sand— 
and ashen terror gripped the men. 

But now, fearing death, all eyes fixed on Charybdis— 
now Scylla snatched six men from our hollow ship, 


[246-77] BOOK 12: THE CATTLE OF THE SUN 279 


the toughest, strongest hands I had, and glancing 

backward over the decks, searching for my crew 

I could see their hands and feet already hoisted, 

flailing, high, higher, over my head, look— 

wailing down at me, comrades riven in agony, 

shrieking out my name for one last time! 270 
Just as an angler poised on a jutting rock 

flings his treacherous bait in the offshore swell, 

whips his long rod—hook sheathed in an oxhorn lure— 

and whisks up little fish he flips on the beach-break, 

writhing, gasping out their lives . . . so now they writhed, 

gasping as Scylla swung them up her cliff and there 

at her cavern’s mouth she bolted them down raw— 

screaming out, flinging their arms toward me, 

lost in that mortal struggle . . . 

Of all the pitiful things I’ve had to witness, 280 
suffering, searching out the pathways of the sea, 

this wrenched my heart the most. 

But now, at last, 
putting the Rocks, Scylla and dread Charybdis far astern, 
we quickly reached the good green island of the Sun 
where Helios, lord Hyperion, keeps his fine cattle, 
broad in the brow, and flocks of purebred sheep. 

Still aboard my black ship in the open sea 

I could hear the lowing cattle driven home, 

the bleating sheep. And I was struck once more 

by the words of the blind Theban prophet, Tiresias, 290 
and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me 

to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man. 

So I warned my shipmates gravely, sick at heart, 

‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship, 

let me tell you the dire prophecies of Tiresias 

and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me 

to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man. 

Here, they warned, the worst disaster awaits us. 

Row straight past these shores—race our black ship on!’ 


So I said, and the warnings broke their hearts. 300 


280 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [278-311] 


But Eurylochus waded in at once—with mutiny on his mind: 
‘You're a hard man, Odysseus. Your fighting spirit’s 

stronger than ours, your stamina never fails. 

You must be made of iron head to foot. Look, 

your crew’s half-dead with labor, starved for sleep, 

and you forbid us to set foot on land, this island here, 

washed by the waves, where we might catch a decent meal again. 
Drained as we are, night falling fast, you’d have us desert 

this haven and blunder off, into the mist-bound seas? 

Out of the night come winds that shatter vessels— 310 
how can a man escape his headlong death 

if suddenly, out of nowhere, a cyclone hits, 

bred by the South or stormy West Wind? They’re the gales 

that tear a ship to splinters—the gods, our masters, 

willing or not, it seems. No, let’s give way 

to the dark night, set out our supper here. 

Sit tight by our swift ship and then at daybreak 

board and launch her, make for open sea!’ 


So Eurylochus urged, and shipmates cheered. 
Then I knew some power was brewing trouble for us, 320 
so I let fly.with an anxious plea: ‘Eurylochus, 
I’m one against all—the upper hand is yours. 
But swear me a binding oath, all here, that if 
we come on a herd of cattle or fine flock of sheep, 
not one man among us—blind in his reckless ways— 
will slaughter an ox or ram. Just eat in peace, 
content with the food immortal Circe gave us.’ 


They quickly swore the oath that I required 
and once they had vowed they’d never harm the herds, 
they moored our sturdy ship in the deep narrow harbor, ’ 330 
close to a fresh spring, and all hands disembarked 
and adeptly set about the evening meal. 
Once they’d put aside desire for food and drink, 
they recalled our dear companions, wept for the men 
that Scylla plucked from the hollow ship and ate alive, 
and a welcome sleep came on them in their tears. 


[312-45] peron 2. PREPCATTVE OF THE SUN 


But then, 
at the night’s third watch, the stars just wheeling down, 
Zeus who marshals the stormclouds loosed a ripping wind, 
a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over in thunderheads 
the earth and sea at once—and night swept down from the sky. 
When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 
we hauled our craft ashore, securing her in a vaulted cave 


where nymphs have lovely dancing-rings and hold their sessions. 


There I called a muster, warning my shipmates yet again, 
‘Friends, we’ve food and drink aplenty aboard the ship— 
keep your hands off all these herds or we will pay the price! 
The cattle, the sleek flocks, belong to an awesome master, 
Helios, god of the sun who sees all, hears all things.’ 


So I warned, and my headstrong men complied. 
But for one whole month the South Wind blew nonstop, 
no other wind came up, none but the South-southeast. 
As long as our food and ruddy wine held out, the crew, 
eager to save their lives, kept hands off the herds. 
But then, when supplies aboard had all run dry, 
when the men turned to hunting, forced to range 
for quarry with twisted hooks: for fish, birds, 
anything they could lay their hands on— 
hunger racked their bellies—I struck inland, 
up the island, there to pray to the gods. 
If only one might show me some way home! 
Crossing into the heartland, clear of the crew, 
I rinsed my hands in a sheltered spot, a windbreak, 
but soon as I'd prayed to all the gods who rule Olympus, 
down on my eyes they poured a sweet, sound sleep . . . 
as Eurylochus opened up his fatal plan to friends: 
‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship. 
All ways of dying are hateful to us poor mortals, 
true, but to die of hunger, starve to death— 
that’s the worst of all. So up with you now, 
let’s drive off the pick of Helios’ sleek herds, 
slaughter them to the gods who rule the skies up there. 
If we ever make it home to Ithaca, native ground, 


281

282 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [346-79] 


erect at once a glorious temple to the Sungod, 

line the walls with hoards of dazzling gifts! 

But if the Sun, inflamed for his longhorn cattle, 

means to wreck our ship and the other gods pitch in— 
I'd rather die at sea, with one deep gulp of death, 

than die by inches on this desolate island here!’ 


So he urged, and shipmates cheered again. 
At once they drove off the Sungod’s finest cattlk— 380 
close at hand, not far from the blue-prowed ship they grazed, 
those splendid beasts with their broad brows and curving horns. 
Surrounding them in a ring, they lifted prayers to the gods, 
plucking fresh green leaves from a tall oak for the rite, 
since white strewing-barley was long gone in the ship. 
Once they'd prayed, slaughtered and skinned the cattle, 
they cut the thighbones out, they wrapped them round in fat, 
a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh. 
And since they had no wine to anoint the glowing victims, 
they made libations with water, broiling all the innards, 390 
and once they’d burned the bones and tasted the organs— 
hacked the rest into pieces, piercing them with spits. 


That moment soothing slumber fell from my eyes 
and down I went to our ship at the water’s edge 
but on my way, nearing the long beaked craft, 
the smoky savor of roasts came floating up around me... 
I groaned in anguish, crying out to the deathless gods: 
‘Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die— 
you with your fatal sleep, you lulled me into disaster. 
Left on their own, look what a monstrous thing 400 
my crew concocted!’ 

Quick as a flash 

with her flaring robes Lampetie sped the news 
to the Sun on high that we had killed his herds 
and Helios burst out in rage to all the immortals: 
‘Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die— 
punish them all, that crew of Laertes’ son Odysseus— 
what an outrage! They, they killed my cattle, 


[379-408] BOOK 12: THE CATTLE OF THE SUN 283 


the great joy of my heart .. . day in, day out, 

when I climbed the starry skies and when I wheeled 

back down from the heights to touch the earth once more. 410 
Unless they pay me back in blood for the butchery of my herds, 

down I go to the House of Death and blaze among the dead!’ 


But Zeus who marshals the thunderheads insisted, 
‘Sun, you keep on shining among the deathless gods 
and mortal men across the good green earth. 

And as for the guilty ones, why, soon enough 
on the wine-dark sea I'll hit their racing ship 
with a white-hot bolt, I’ll tear it into splinters.’ 


—Or so I heard from the lovely nymph Calypso, 
who heard it herself, she said, from Hermes, god of guides. 420 


As soon as I reached our ship at the water’s edge 
I took the men to task, upbraiding each in turn, 
but how to set things right? We couldn’t find a way. 
The cattle were dead already... 
and the gods soon showed us all some fateful signs— 
the hides began to crawl, the meat, both raw and roasted, 
bellowed out on the spits, and we heard a noise 
like the moan of lowing oxen. 

Yet six more days 

my eager companions feasted on the cattle of the Sun, 
the pick of the herds they'd driven off, but then, 430 
when Cronian Zeus brought on the seventh day, 
the wind in its ceaseless raging dropped at last, 
and stepping the mast at once, hoisting the white sail 
we boarded ship and launched her, made for open sea. 


But once we'd left that island in our wake— 
no land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky— 
then Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead 
above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it. 
Nor did the craft scud on much longer. All of a sudden 
killer-squalls attacked us, screaming out of the west, 440 


284 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [408-40] 


a murderous blast shearing the two forestays off 

so the mast toppled backward, its running tackle spilling 
into the bilge. The mast itself went crashing into the stern, 
it struck the helmsman’s head and crushed his skull to pulp 
and down from his deck the man flipped like a diver— 

his hardy life spirit left his bones behind. 

Then, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft 

with a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun, 

reeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone, 
shipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks 450 
swept along by the whitecaps past the trim black hull— 
and the god cut short their journey home forever. 


But I went lurching along our battered hulk 
till the sea-surge ripped the plankings from the keel 
and the waves swirled it away, stripped bare, and snapped 
the mast from the decks—but a backstay made of bull’s-hide 
still held fast, and with this I lashed the mast and keel 
together, made them one, riding my makeshift raft 
as the wretched galewinds bore me on and on. 


At last the West Wind quit its wild rage 460 
but the South came on at once to hound me even more, 
making me double back my route toward cruel Charybdis. 
All night long I was rushed back and then at break of day 
I reached the crag of Scylla and dire Charybdis’ vortex 
right when the dreadful whirlpool gulped the salt sea down. 
But heaving myself aloft to clutch at the fig-tree’s height, 
like a bat I clung to its trunk for dear life—not a chance 
for a good firm foothold there, no clambering up it either, 
the roots too far to reach, the boughs too high overhead, 
huge swaying branches that overshadowed Charybdis. 470 
But I held on, dead set . . . waiting for her . 
to vomit my mast and keel back up again— 
Oh how I ached for both! and back they came, 
Jate but at last, at just the hour a judge at court, 
who’s settled the countless suits of brash young claimants, 
rises, the day’s work done, and turns home for supper— 


[441-53] HOOK 12: THE CATTLE OF THE SUN 285 


that’s when the timbers reared back up from Charybdis. 

I let go—I plunged with my hands and feet flailing, 

crashing into the waves beside those great beams 

and scrambling aboard them fast 480 
I rowed hard with my hands right through the straits .. . 

And the father of men and gods did not let Scylla see me, 

else I’d have died on the spot—no escape from death. 


I drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at night, 
the gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso’s island, 
home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids 
who speaks with human voice, and she took me in, 
she loved me... Why cover the same ground again? 
Just yesterday, here at hall, I told you all the rest, 
you and your gracious wife. It goes against my grain 490 
to repeat a tale told once, and told so clearly.”

Odysseus Strings 
His Bow 


The time had come. The goddess Athena with her blazing eyes 
inspired Penelope, Icarius’ daughter, wary, poised, 

to set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out 

before her suitors waiting in Odysseus’ hall— 

to test their skill and bring their slaughter on. 

Up the steep stairs to her room she climbed 

and grasped in a steady hand the curved key— 

fine bronze, with ivory haft attached— 

and then with her chamber-women made her way 

to a hidden storeroom, far in the palace depths, . 10 
and there they lay, the royal master’s treasures: 

bronze, gold and a wealth of hard wrought iron 

and there it lay as well .. . his backsprung bow 

with its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain. 

Gifts from the old days, from a friend he’d met 


424 


[13-43] meok 21; ODYSSEUS SPRINGS HIS BOW 


in Lacedaemon—Iphitus, Eurytus’ gallant son. 
Once in Messene the two struck up together, 
in sly Ortilochus’ house, that time Odysseus 
went to collect a debt the whole realm owed him, 
for Messenian raiders had lifted flocks from Ithaca, 
three hundred head in their oarswept ships, the herdsmen too. 
So his father and island elders sent Odysseus off, 
a young boy on a mission, 
a distant embassy made to right that wrong. 
Iphitus went there hunting the stock that he had lost, 
a dozen mares still nursing their hardy suckling mules. 
The same mares that would prove his certain death 
when he reached the son of Zeus, that iron heart, 
Heracles—the past master of monstrous works— 
who killed the man, a guest in his own house. 
Brutal. Not a care for the wrathful eyes of god 
or rites of hospitality he had spread before him, 
no, he dined him, then he murdered him, commandeered 
those hard-hoofed mares for the hero’s own grange. 
Still on the trail of these when he met Odysseus, 
Iphitus gave him the bow his father, mighty Eurytus, 
used to wield as a young man, but when he died 
in his lofty house he left it to his son. 
In turn, Odysseus gave his friend a sharp sword 
and a rugged spear to mark the start of friendship, 
treasured ties that bind. But before they got to know 
the warmth of each other’s board, the son of Zeus 
had murdered Iphitus, Eurytus’ magnificent son 
who gave the prince the bow. 

That great weapon— 
King Odysseus never took it abroad with him 
when he sailed off to war in his long black ships. 
He kept it stored away in his stately house, 
guarding the memory of a cherished friend, 
and only took that bow on hunts at home. 

Now, 

the lustrous queen soon reached the hidden vault 
and stopped at the oaken doorsill, work an expert

sanded smooth and trued to the line some years ago, 

planting the doorjambs snugly, hanging shining doors. 

At once she loosed the thong from around its hook, 

inserted the key and aiming straight and true, 

shot back the bolts—and the rasping doors groaned 

as loud as a bull will bellow, champing grass at pasture. 

So as the key went home those handsome double doors 

rang out now and sprang wide before her. 

She stepped onto a plank where chests stood tall, 60 
brimming with clothing scented sweet with cedar. 

Reaching, tiptoe, lifting the bow down off its peg, 

still secure in the burnished case that held it, 

down she sank, laying the case across her knees, 

and dissolved in tears with a high thin wail 

as she drew her husband’s weapon from its sheath .. . 

Then, having wept and sobbed to her heart’s content, 

off she went to the hall to meet her proud admirers, 

cradling her husband’s backsprung bow in her arms, 

its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain. 70 
Her women followed, bringing a chest that held 

the bronze and the iron axes, trophies won by the master. 

That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors, 

drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks, 

paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof, 

with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side, 

and delivered an ultimatum to her suitors: 

“Listen to me, my overbearing friends! 

You who plague this palace night and day, 

drinking, eating us out of house and home 80 
with the lord and master absent, gone so long— 

the only excuse that you can offer is your zest 

to win me as your bride. So, to arms, my gallants! 

Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look— 

I set before you the great bow of King Odysseus now! 
The hand that can string this bow with greatest ease, 

that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes— 

he is the man I follow, yes, forsaking this house 

where I was once a bride, this gracious house 


[78-108] BOOK 21: ODYSSEUS STRINGS HIS BOW 


so filled with the best that life can offer— 
I shall always remember it, that I know... 
even in my dreams.” 

She turned to Eumaeus, 
ordered the good swineherd now to set the bow 
and the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors. 
He broke into tears as he received them, laid them down. 
The cowherd wept too, when he saw his master’s bow. 
But Antinous wheeled on both and let them have it: 
“Yokels, fools—you can’t tell night from day! 
You mawkish idiots, why are you sniveling here? 
You’re stirring up your mistress! Isn’t she drowned 
in grief already? She’s lost her darling husband. 
Sit down. Eat in peace, or take your snuffling 
out of doors! But leave that bow right here— 
our crucial test that makes or breaks us all. 
No easy game, I wager, to string His polished bow. 
Not a soul in the crowd can match Odysseus— 
what a man he was... 
I saw him once, remember him to this day, 
though I was young and foolish way back then.” 

Smooth talk, 
but deep in the suitor’s heart his hopes were bent 
on stringing the bow and shooting through the axes. 
Antinous—fated to be the first man to taste 
an arrow whipped from great Odysseus’ hands, 
the king he mocked, at ease in the king’s house, 
egging comrades on to mock him too. 
“Amazing!” 

Prince Telemachus waded in with a laugh: 
“Zeus up there has robbed me of my wits. 
My own dear mother, sensible as she is, 
says she’ll marry again, forsake our house, 
and look at me—laughing for all I’m worth, 
giggling like some fool. Step up, my friends! 
Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look— 
a woman who has no equal now in all Achaean country, 
neither in holy Pylos, nor in Argos or Mycenae,

not even Ithaca itself or the loamy mainland. 

You know it well. Why sing my mother’s praises? 

Come, let the games begin! No dodges, no delays, 

no turning back from the stringing of the bow— 

we'll see who wins, we will. 

I'd even take a crack at the bow myself... 

If I string it and shoot through all the axes, 

I’d worry less if my noble mother left our house 

with another man and left me here behind—man enough 
at last to win my father’s splendid prizes!” 

With that 
he leapt to his feet and dropped his bright-red cloak, 
slipping the sword and sword-belt off his shoulders. 

First he planted the axes, digging a long trench, 

one for all, and trued them all to a line 

then tamped the earth to bed them. Wonder took 

the revelers looking on: his work so firm, precise, 

though he’d never seen the axes ranged before. 

He stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow. . . 

Three times he made it shudder, straining to bend it, 
three times his power flagged—but his hopes ran high 
he’d string his father’s bow and shoot through every iron 
and now, struggling with all his might for the fourth time, 
he would have strung the bow, but Odysseus shook his head 
and stopped him short despite his tensing zeal. 

“God help me,” the inspired prince cried out, 

“must I be a weakling, a failure all my life? 

Unless I’m just too young to trust my hands 

to fight off any man who rises up against me. 

Come, my betters, so much stronger than I am— 

try the bow and finish off the contest.” 


He propped his father’s weapon on the ground, 
tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors 
and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn, 
then back he went to the seat that he had left. 
“Up, friends!” Antinous called, taking over. 

“One man after another, left to right,

starting from where the steward pours the wine.” 


So Antinous urged and all agreed. 
The first man up was Leodes, Oenops’ son, 
a seer who could see their futures in the smoke, 
who always sat by the glowing winebowl, well back, 
the one man in the group who loathed their reckless ways, 
appalled by all their outrage. His turn first... 
Picking up the weapon now and the swift arrow, 
he stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow 
but failed to bend it. As soon as he tugged the string 
his hands went slack, his soft, uncallused hands, 
and he called back to the suitors, “Friends, 
I can’t bend it. Take it, someone—try. 
Here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath, 
all our best contenders! Still, better be dead 
than live on here, never winning the prize 
that tempts us all—forever in pursuit, 
burning with expectation every day. 
If there’s still a suitor here who hopes, 
who aches to marry Penelope, Odysseus’ wife, 
just let him try the bow; he’ll see the truth! 
He'll soon lay siege to another Argive woman 
trailing her long robes, and shower her with gifts— 
and then our queen can marry the one who offers most, 
the man marked out by fate to be her husband.” 


With those words he thrust the bow aside, 
tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors 
and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn, 
then back he went to the seat that he had left. 
But Antinous turned on the seer, abuses flying: 
“Leodes! what are you saying? what's got past your lips? 
What awful, grisly nonsense—it shocks me to hear it— 
‘here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath!’ 
Just because you can’t string it, you’re so weak? 
Clearly your genteel mother never bred her boy 
for the work of bending bows and shooting arrows.

We have champions in our ranks to string it quickly. 

Hop to it, Melanthius!”—he barked at the goatherd— 
“Rake the fire in the hall, pull up a big stool, 

heap it with fleece and fetch that hefty ball 

of lard from the stores inside. So we young lords 

can heat and limber the bow and rub it down with grease 
before we try again and finish off the contest!” 


The goatherd bustled about to rake the fire 
still going strong. He pulled up a big stool, 
heaped it with fleece and fetched the hefty ball 
of lard from the stores inside. And the young men 
limbered the bow, rubbing it down with hot grease, 
then struggled to bend it back but failed. No use— 
they fell far short of the strength the bow required. 
Antinous still held off, dashing Eurymachus too, 
the ringleaders of all the suitors, 
head and shoulders the strongest of the lot. 

But now 
the king’s two men, the cowherd and the swineherd, 
had slipped out of the palace side-by-side 
and great Odysseus left the house to join them. 

Once they were past the courtyard and the gates 

he probed them deftly, surely: “Cowherd, swineherd, 
what, shall I blurt this out or keep it to myself? 

No, speak out. The heart inside me says so. 

How far would you go to fight beside Odysseus? 

Say he dropped like that from a clear blue sky 

and a god brought him back— 

would you fight for the suitors or your king? 

Tell me how you feel inside your hearts.” 


“Father Zeus,” the trusty cowherd shouted, 
“bring my prayer to pass! Let the master come— 
some god guide him now! You'd see my power, 
my fighting arms in action!” 


EFumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods 


[174-203]

that their wise king would soon come home again. 
Certain at least these two were loyal to the death, 
Odysseus reassured them quickly: “I’m right here, 

here in the flesh—myself—and home at last, 

after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship. 

Now I know that of all my men you two alone 

longed for my return. From the rest I’ve heard 

not one real prayer that I come back again. 

So now I'll tell you what’s in store for you. 

If a god beats down the lofty suitors at my hands, 

I’ll find you wives, both of you, grant you property, 
sturdy houses beside my own, and in my eyes you'll be 
comrades to Prince Telemachus, brothers from then on. 
Come, I'll show you something—living proof— 

know me for certain, put your minds at rest. 

This scar, 
look, where a boar’s white tusk gored me, years ago, 
hunting on Parnassus, Autolycus’ sons and I.” 

With that, 
pushing back his rags, he revealed the great scar... 
And the men gazed at it, scanned it, knew it well, 
broke into tears and threw their arms around their master— 
lost in affection, kissing his head and shoulders, 
and so Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. 

Now the sun would have set upon their tears 

if Odysseus had not called a halt himself. 

“No more weeping. Coming out of the house 

a man might see us, tell the men inside. 

Let’s slip back in—singly, not in a pack. 

I'll go first. You’re next. Here’s our signal. 

When all the rest in there, our lordly friends, 

are dead against my having the bow and quiver, 
good Eumaeus, carry the weapon down the hall 
and put it in my hands. Then tell the serving-women 
to lock the snugly fitted doors to their own rooms. 
If anyone hears from there the jolting blows 

and groans of men, caught in our huge net, 

not one of them show her face—

sit tight, keep to her weaving, not a sound. 
You, my good Philoetius, here are your orders. 
Shoot the bolt of the courtyard’s outer gate, 
lock it, lash it fast.” 

With that command 
the master entered his well-constructed house 
and back he went to the stool that he had left. 
The king’s two men, in turn, slipped in as well. 


Just now Eurymachus held the bow in his hands, 
turning it over, tip to tip, before the blazing fire 
to heat the weapon. But he failed to bend it even so 
and the suitor’s high heart groaned to bursting. 
“A black day,” he exclaimed in wounded pride, 
“a blow to myself, a blow to each man here! 
It’s less the marriage that mortifies me now— 
that’s galling too, but lots of women are left, 
some in seagirt Ithaca, some in other cities. 
What breaks my heart is the fact we fall so short 
of great Odysseus’ strength we cannot string his bow. 
A disgrace to ring in the ears of men to come.” 


“Eurymachus,” Eupithes’ son Antinous countered, 
“it will never come to that, as you well know. 
Today is a feast-day up and down the island 
in honor of the Archer God. Who flexes bows today? 
Set it aside. Rest easy now. And all the axes, 
let’s just leave them planted where they are. 
Trust me, no one’s about to crash the gates 
of Laertes’ son and carry off these trophies. 
Steward, pour some drops for the god in every cup, 
we'll tip the wine, then put the bow to bed. 
And first thing in the morning have Melanthius 
bring the pick of his goats from all his herds 
so we can burn the thighs to Apollo, god of archers— 
then try the bow and finish off the contest.” 


Welcome advice. And again they all agreed.

Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing, 
the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine, 
they tipped first drops for the god in every cup, 
then poured full rounds for all. And now, once 
they’d tipped libations out and drunk their fill, 
the king of craft, Odysseus, said with all his cunning, 
“Listen to me, you lords who court the noble queen. 
I have to say what the heart inside me urges. 
I appeal especially to Eurymachus, and you, 
brilliant Antinous, who spoke so shrewdly now. 
Give the bow a rest for today, leave it to the gods— 
at dawn the Archer God will grant a victory 
to the man he favors most. 
For the moment, 

give me the polished bow now, won’t you? So, 
to amuse you all, I can try my hand, my strength... 
is the old force still alive inside these gnarled limbs? 
Or has a life of roaming, years of rough neglect, 
destroyed it long ago?” 

Modest words 
that sent them all into hot, indignant rage, 
fearing he just might string the polished bow. 
So Antinous rounded on him, dressed him down: 
“Not a shred of sense in your head, you filthy drifter! 
Not content to feast at your ease with us, the island’s pride? 
Never denied your full share of the banquet, never, 
you can listen in on our secrets. No one else 
can eavesdrop on our talk, no tramp, no beggar. 
The wine has overpowered you, heady wine— 
the ruin of many another man, whoever 
gulps it down and drinks beyond his limit. 
Wine—it drove the Centaur, famous Eurytion, 
mad in the halls of lionhearted Pirithous. 
There to visit the Lapiths, crazed with wine 
the headlong Centaur bent to his ugly work 
in the prince’s own house! His hosts sprang up, 
seized with fury, dragged him across the forecourt, 
flung him out of doors, hacking his nose and ears off

with their knives, no mercy. The creature reeled away, 
still blind with drink, his heart like a wild storm, 
loaded with all the frenzy in his mind! 

And so 


the feud between mortal men and Centaurs had its start. 


But the drunk was first to bring disaster on himself 
by drowning in his cups. You too, I promise you 
no end of trouble if you should string that bow. 
You'll meet no kindness in our part of the world— 
we'll sail you off in a black ship to Echetus, 

the mainland king who wrecks all men alive. 
Nothing can save you from his royal grip! 

So drink, but hold your peace, 

don’t take on the younger, stronger men.” 


“Antinous,” watchful Penelope stepped in, 
“how impolite it would be, how wrong, to scant 
whatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house. 
You really think—if the stranger trusts so to his hands 
and strength that he strings Odysseus’ great bow— 
he’ll take me home and claim me as his bride? 
He never dreamed of such a thing, I’m sure. 
Don’t let that ruin the feast for any reveler here. 
Unthinkable—nothing, nothing could be worse.” 


Polybus’ son Eurymachus had an answer: 
“Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, do we really 
expect the man to wed you? Unthinkable, I know. 
But we do recoil at the talk of men and women. 
One of the island’s meaner sort will mutter, 
‘Look at the riffraff courting a king’s wife. 
Weaklings, look, they can’t even string his bow. 
But along came this beggar, drifting out of the blue— 


strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes!’ 


Gossip will fly. We’ll hang our heads in shame.” 


“Shame?” alert Penelope protested—

[331-60] Beek 21. ODYSSEUS STRINGS HIS BOW 


“How can you hope for any public fame at all? 

You who disgrace, devour a great man’s house and home! 

Why hang your heads in shame over next to nothing? 

Our friend here is a strapping, well-built man 

and claims to be the son of a noble father. 

Come, hand him the bow now, let’s just see... 

I tell you this—and I'll make good my word— 

if he strings the bow and Apollo grants him glory, 

I’ll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes, 

I'll give him a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs, 

give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet 

and send him off, wherever his heart desires.” 
“Mother,” 

poised Telemachus broke in now, “my father’s bow— 

no Achaean on earth has more right than I 

to give it or withhold it, as I please. 

Of all the lords in Ithaca’s rocky heights 

_ or the islands facing Elis grazed by horses, 

_ nota single one will force or thwart my will, 

| even if I decide to give our guest this bow— 

a gift outright—to carry off himself. 

. So, mother, 

| go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks, 

the distaff and the loom, and keep the women 

| working hard as well. As for the bow now, 

| men will see to that, but I most of all: 

| Lhold the reins of power in this house.” 

| Astonished, 

| she withdrew to her own room. She took to heart 

| the clear good sense in what her son had said. 

| Climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women, 

she fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband, 

| till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. 


And now the loyal swineherd had lifted up the bow, 
was taking it toward the king, when all the suitors 
| burst out in an ugly uproar through the palace—

brash young bullies, this or that one heckling, 
“Where on earth are you going with that bow?” 


“You, you grubby swineherd, are you crazy?” 


“The speedy dogs you reared will eat your corpse—” 


“Out there with your pigs, out in the cold, alone!” 
“If only Apollo and all the gods shine down on us!” 


Eumaeus froze in his tracks, put down the bow, 
panicked by every outcry in the hall. 
Telemachus shouted too, from the other side, 
and full of threats: “Carry on with the bow, old boy! 
If you serve too many masters, you'll soon suffer. 
Look sharp, or I'll pelt you back to your farm 
with flying rocks. I may be younger than you 
but I’m much stronger. If only I had that edge 
in fists and brawn over all this courting crowd, 
I'd soon dispatch them—licking their wounds at last— 
clear of our palace where they plot their vicious plots!” 


His outburst sent them all into gales of laughter, 
blithe and oblivious, that dissolved their pique 
against the prince. The swineherd took the bow, 
carried it down the hall to his ready, waiting king 
and standing by him, placed it in his hands, 
then he called the nurse aside and whispered, 
“Good Eurycleia—Telemachus commands you now 
to lock the snugly fitted doors to your own rooms. 
If anyone hears from there the jolting blows 
and groans of men, caught in our huge net, 
not one of you show your face— 
sit tight, keep to your weaving, not a sound.” 


That silenced the old nurse— 
she barred the doors that led from the long hall.

The cowherd quietly bounded out of the house 
to lock the gates of the high-stockaded court. 
Under the portico lay a cable, ship’s tough gear: 
he lashed the gates with this, then slipped back in 
and ran and sat on the stool that he’d just left, 
eyes riveted on Odysseus. 

Now he held the bow 
in his own hands, turning it over, tip to tip, 
testing it, this way, that way . . . fearing worms 


had bored through the weapon’s horn with the master gone abroad. 


A suitor would glance at his neighbor, jeering, taunting, 
“Look at our connoisseur of bows!” 

“Sly old fox— 
maybe he’s got bows like it, stored in his house.” 


“That or he’s bent on making one himself.” 
“Look how he twists and turns it in his hands!” 
“The clever tramp means trouble—” 


“I wish him luck,” some cocksure lord chimed in, 
“as good as his luck in bending back that weapon!” 


So they mocked, but Odysseus, mastermind in action, 
once he’d handled the great bow and scanned every inch, 
then, like an expert singer skilled at lyre and song— 
who strains a string to a new peg with ease, 
making the pliant sheep-gut fast at either end— 
so with his virtuoso ease Odysseus strung his mighty bow. 
Quickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch 


and under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow’s cry. 


Horror swept through the suitors, faces blanching white, 

and Zeus cracked the sky with a bolt, his blazing sign, 

and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last 
that the son of cunning Cronus flung that omen down for him. 
He snatched a winged arrow lying bare on the board— 

the rest still bristled deep inside the quiver,

soon to be tasted by all the feasters there. 
Setting shaft on the handgrip, drawing the notch 
and bowstring back, back . . . right from his stool, 
just as he sat but aiming straight and true, he let fly— 
and never missing an ax from the first ax-handle 
clean on through to the last and out 470 
the shaft with its weighted brazen head shot free! 
“Telemachus,” 
Odysseus looked to his son and said, “your guest, 
sitting here in your house, has not disgraced you. 
No missing the mark, look, and no long labor spent 
to string the bow. My strength’s not broken yet, 
not quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought. 
But the hour has come to serve our masters right— 
supper in broad daylight—then to other revels, 
song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.” 


He paused with a warning nod, and at that sign 480 
Prince Telemachus, son of King Odysseus, 
girding his sharp sword on, clamping hand to spear, 
took his stand by a chair that flanked his father— 
his bronze spearpoint glinting now like fire...

Now stripping back his rags Odysseus master of craft and battle 
vaulted onto the great threshold, gripping his bow and quiver 
bristling arrows, and poured his flashing shafts before him, 

loose at his feet, and thundered out to all the suitors: 
“Look—your crucial test is finished, now, at last! 

But another target’s left that no one’s hit before— 

we'll see if J can hit it—Apollo give me glory!” 


With that he trained a stabbing arrow on Antinous... 
just lifting a gorgeous golden loving-cup in his hands, 
just tilting the two-handled goblet back to his lips, 10 
about to drain the wine—and slaughter the last thing 
on the suitor’s mind: who could dream that one foe 
in that crowd of feasters, however great his power, 
would bring down death on himself, and black doom? 


439 


440 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [15-42] 


But Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat 
and the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out— 
and off to the side he pitched, the cup dropped from his grasp 
as the shaft sank home, and the man’s life-blood came spurting 
from his nostrils— 
thick red jets— 

a sudden thrust of his foot— 

he kicked away the table— 
food showered across the floor, 20 

the bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody filth. 
The suitors burst into uproar all throughout the house 
when they saw their leader down. They leapt from their seats, 
milling about, desperate, scanning the stone walls— 
not a shield in sight, no rugged spear to seize. 
They wheeled on Odysseus, lashing out in fury: 
“Stranger, shooting at men will cost your life!” 


“Your game is over—you, you’ve shot your last!” 
“You'll never escape your own headlong death!” 
“You killed the best in Ithaca—our fine prince!” 30 


“Vultures will eat your corpse!” 
Groping, frantic— 
each one persuading himself the guest had killed 
the man by chance. Poor fools, blind to the fact 
that all their necks were in the noose, their doom sealed. 
With a dark look, the wily fighter Odysseus shouted back, 
“You dogs! you never imagined I’d return from Troy— 
so cocksure that you bled my house to death, 
ravished my serving-women—wooed my wife 
behind my back while I was still alive! 
No fear of the gods who rule the skies up there, 40 
no fear that men’s revenge might arrive someday— 
now all your necks are in the noose—your doom is sealed!” 


Terror gripped them all, blanched their faces white, 


[43-76] BOOK 22: SLAUGHTER IN THE HALL 44] 


each man glancing wildly—how to escape his instant death? 

Only Eurymachus had the breath to venture, “If you, 

you're truly Odysseus of Ithaca, home at last, 

you're right to accuse these men of what they’ve done— 

so much reckless outrage here in your palace, 

so much on your lands. But here he lies, 

quite dead, and he incited it all—Antinous— 50 
look, the man who drove us all to crime! 

Not that he needed marriage, craved it so; 

he’d bigger game in mind—though Zeus barred his way— 

he’d lord it over Ithaca’s handsome country, king himself, 

once he’d lain in wait for your son and cut him down! 

But now he’s received the death that he deserved. 

So spare your own people! Later we'll recoup 

your costs with a tax laid down upon the land, 

covering all we ate and drank inside your halls, 

and each of us here will pay full measure too— 60 
twenty oxen in value, bronze and gold we’ll give 

until we melt your heart. Before we've settled, 

who on earth could blame you for your rage?” 


But the battle-master kept on glaring, seething. 
“No, Eurymachus! Not if you paid me all your father’s wealth— 
all you possess now, and all that could pour in from the world’s end— 
no, not even then would I stay my hands from slaughter 
till all you suitors had paid for all your crimes! 
Now life or death—your choice—fight me or flee 
if you hope to escape your sudden bloody doom! 70 
I doubt one man in the lot will save his skin!” 


His menace shook their knees, their hearts too 
but Eurymachus spoke again, now to the suitors: “Friends! 
This man will never restrain his hands, invincible hands— 
now that he’s seized that polished bow and quiver, look, 
he’ll shoot from the sill until he’s killed us all! 
So fight—call up the joy of battle! Swords out! 
Tables lifted—block his arrows winging death! 
Charge him, charge in a pack— 


442 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


try to rout the man from the sill, the doors, 
race through town and sound an alarm at once— 
our friend would soon see he’s shot his bolt!” 

Brave talk— 
he drew his two-edged sword, bronze, honed for the kill 
and hurled himself at the king with a raw savage cry 
in the same breath that Odysseus loosed an arrow 
ripping his breast beside the nipple so hard 
it lodged in the man’s liver— 
out of his grasp the sword dropped to the ground— 
over his table, head over heels he tumbled, doubled up, 
flinging his food and his two-handled cup across the floor— 
he smashed the ground with his forehead, writhing in pain, 
both feet flailing out, and his high seat tottered— 
the mist of death came swirling down his eyes. 


Amphinomus rushed the king in all his glory, 
charging him face-to-face, a slashing sword drawn— 
if only he could force him clear of the doorway, now, 
but Telemachus—too quick—stabbed the man from behind, 
plunging his bronze spear between the suitor’s shoulders 
and straight on through his chest the point came jutting out— 
down he went with a thud, his forehead slammed the ground. 
Telemachus swerved aside, leaving his long spearshaft 
lodged in Amphinomus—fearing some suitor just might 
lunge in from behind as he tugged the shaft, 
impale him with a sword or hack him down, 
crouching over the corpse. 
He went on the run, reached his father at once 
and halting right beside him, let fly, “Father— 
now I'll get you a shield and a pair of spears, 
a helmet of solid bronze to fit your temples! 
I’ll arm myself on the way back and hand out 
arms to the swineherd, arm the cowherd too— 
we'd better fight equipped!” 
“Run, fetch them,” 
the wily captain urged, “while I’ve got arrows left 
to defend me—or they’ll force me from the doors 


[76-107] 


80

100 


110 


[107-40] BOOK 22: SLAUGHPER IN THE HALL 


while I fight on alone!” 


Telemachus moved to his father’s orders smartly. 
Off he ran to the room where the famous arms lay stored, 
took up four shields, eight spears, four bronze helmets 
ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these, 
ran back to reach his father’s side in no time. 
The prince was first to case himself in bronze 
and his servants followed suit—both harnessed up 
and all three flanked Odysseus, mastermind of war, 
and he, as long as he’d arrows left to defend himself, 
kept picking suitors off in the palace, one by one 
and down they went, corpse on corpse in droves. 
Then, when the royal archer’s shafts ran out, 
he leaned his bow on a post of the massive doors— 
where walls of the hallway catch the light—and armed: 
across his shoulder he slung a buckler four plies thick, 
over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet, 
the horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror, 
and grasped two rugged lances tipped with fiery bronze. 


Now a side-door was fitted into the main wall— 
right at the edge of the great hall’s stone sill— 
and led to a passage always shut by good tight boards. 
But Odysseus gave the swineherd strict commands 
to stand hard by the side-door, guard it well— 
the only way the suitors might break out. 
Agelaus called to his comrades with a plan: 
“Friends, can’t someone climb through the hatch?— 
tell men outside to sound the alarm, be quick— 
our guest would soon see he’d shot his last!” 


The goatherd Melanthius answered, “Not a chance, 
my lord—the door to the courtyard’s much too near, 
dangerous too, the mouth of the passage cramped. 
One strong man could block us, one and all! 

No, I'll fetch you some armor to harness on, 
out of the storeroom—there, nowhere else, I’m sure, 


443 


120 


140 


444 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


the king and his gallant son have stowed their arms!” 


With that the goatherd clambered up through smoke-ducts 
high on the wall and scurried into Odysseus’ storeroom, 
bundled a dozen shields, as many spears and helmets 
ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these, 
rushed back down to the suitors, quickly issued arms. 
Odysseus’ knees shook, his heart too, when he saw them 
buckling on their armor, brandishing long spears— 
here was a battle looming, well he knew. 

He turned at once to Telemachus, warnings flying: 
“A bad break in the fight, my boy! One of the women’s 
tipped the odds against us—or could it be the goatherd?” 


“My fault, father,” the cool clear prince replied, 
“the blame’s all mine. That snug door to the vault, 
I left it ajar—they’ve kept a better watch than I. 
Go, Eumaeus, shut the door to the storeroom, 
check and see if it’s one of the women’s tricks 
or Dolius’ son Melanthius. He’s our man, I'd say.” 


And even as they conspired, back the goatherd 
climbed to the room to fetch more burnished arms, 
but Eumaeus spotted him, quickly told his king 
who stood close by: “Odysseus, wily captain, 
there he goes again, the infernal nuisance— 
just as we suspected—back to the storeroom. 

Give me a clear command! 

Do I kill the man—if I can take him down— 

or drag him back to you, here, to pay in full 

for the vicious work he’s plotted in your house?” 


Odysseus, master of tactics, answered briskly, 
“I and the prince will keep these brazen suitors 
crammed in the hall, for all their battle-fury. 
You two wrench Melanthius’ arms and legs behind him, 
fling him down in the storeroom—lash his back to a plank 
and strap a twisted cable fast to the scoundrel’s body, 


{141-75}

[176-209] BOOK 22: SLAWGHTER INeTHE HALL 


hoist him up a column until he hits the rafters— 
let him dangle in agony, still alive, 
for a good long time!” 


They hung on his orders, keen to do his will. 
Off they ran to the storeroom, unseen by him inside— 
Melanthius, rummaging after arms, deep in a dark recess 
as the two men took their stand, either side of the doorposts, 
poised till the goatherd tried to cross the doorsill .. . 
one hand clutching a crested helmet, the other 
an ample old buckler blotched with mildew, 
the shield Laertes bore as a young soldier once 
but there it lay for ages, seams on the handstraps split— 
Quick, they rushed him, seized him, haled him back by the hair, 
flung him down on the floor, writhing with terror, bound him 
hand and foot with a chafing cord, wrenched his limbs 
back, back till the joints locked tight— 
just as Laertes’ cunning son commanded— 
they strapped a twisted cable round his body, 
hoisted him up a column until he hit the rafters, 
then you mocked him, Eumaeus, my good swineherd: 
“Now stand guard through the whole night, Melanthius— 
stretched out on a soft bed fit for you, your highness! 
You’re bound to see the Morning rising up from the Ocean, 
mounting her golden throne—at just the hour you always 
drive in goats to feast the suitors in the hall!” 


So they left him, trussed in his agonizing sling; 
they clapped on armor again, shut the gleaming doors 
and ran to rejoin Odysseus, mastermind of war. 

And now as the ranks squared off, breathing fury— 
four at the sill confronting a larger, stronger force 
arrayed inside the hall—now Zeus’s daughter Athena, 
taking the build and voice of Mentor, swept in 

and Odysseus, thrilled to see her, cried out, 

“Rescue us, Mentor, now it’s life or death! 

Remember your old comrade—all the service 

I offered you! We were boys together!” 


445

200 


210 


446 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [21041] 


So he cried 
yet knew in his bones it was Athena, Driver of Armies. 220 
But across the hall the suitors brayed against her, 
Agelaus first, his outburst full of threats: 
“Mentor, never let Odysseus trick you into 
siding with him to fight against the suitors. 
Here’s our plan of action, and we will see it through! 
Once we've killed them both, the father and the son, 
we'll kill you too, for all you’re bent on doing 
here in the halls—you'll pay with your own head! 
And once our swords have stopped your violence cold— 
all your property, all in your house, your fields, 230 
we'll lump it all with Odysseus’ rich estate 
and never let your sons live on in your halls 
or free your wife and daughters to walk through town!” 


Naked threats—and Athena hit new heights of rage, 
she lashed out at Odysseus now with blazing accusations: 
“Where's it gone, Odysseus—your power, your fighting heart? 
The great soldier who fought for famous white-armed Helen, 
battling Trojans nine long years—nonstop, no mercy, 
mowing their armies down in grueling battlek— 
you who seized the broad streets of Troy 240 
with your fine strategic stroke! How can you— 
now you've returned to your own house, your own wealth— 
bewail the loss of your combat strength in a war with suitors? 
Come, old friend, stand by me! You'll see action now, 
see how Mentor the son of Alcimus, that brave fighter, 
kills your enemies, pays you back for service!” 

Rousing words— 

but she gave no all-out turning of the tide, not yet, 
she kept on testing Odysseus and his gallant son, 
putting their force and fighting heart to proof. 
For all the world like a swallow in their sight 250 
she flew on high to perch 
on the great hall’s central roofbeam black with smoke. 


But the suitors closed ranks, commanded now by Damastor’s son 


[241-76] BOOK 22: SLAUGHTER IN THE HALL 447 


Agelaus, flanked by Eurynomus, Demoptolemus and Amphimedon, 
Pisander, Polyctor’s son, and Polybus ready, waiting— 
head and shoulders the best and bravest of the lot 
still left to fight for their lives, 
now that the pelting shafts had killed the rest. 
Agelaus spurred his comrades on with battle-plans: 
“Friends, at last the man’s invincible hands are useless! 260 
Mentor has mouthed some empty boasts and flitted off— 
just four are left to fight at the front doors. So now, 
no wasting your long spears—all at a single hurl, 
just six of us launch out in the first wave! 
If Zeus is willing, we may hit Odysseus, 
carry off the glory! The rest are nothing 
once the captain’s down!” 
At his command, 
concentrating their shots, all six hurled as one 
but Athena sent the whole salvo wide of the mark— 
one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors, 270 
another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point 
of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall. 
Seeing his men untouched by the suitors’ flurry, 
steady Odysseus leapt to take command: 
“Friends! now it’s for us to hurl at them, I say, 
into this ruck of suitors! Topping all their crimes 
they’re mad to strip the armor off our bodies!” 


Taking aim at the ranks, all four let fly as one 
and the lances struck home—Odysseus killed Demoptolemus, 
Telemachus killed Euryades—the swineherd, Elatus— 280 
and the cowherd cut Pisander down in blood. 
They bit the dust of the broad floor, all as one. 
Back to the great hall’s far recess the others shrank 
as the four rushed in and plucked up spears from corpses. 


And again the suitors hurled their whetted shafts 
but Athena sent the better part of the salvo wide— 
one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors, 
another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point 


448 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall. 

True, Amphimedon nicked Telemachus on the wrist— 

the glancing blade just barely broke his skin. 

Ctesippus sent a long spear sailing over 

Eumaeus’ buckler, grazing his shoulder blade 

but the weapon skittered off and hit the ground. 

And again those led by the brilliant battle-master 

hurled their razor spears at the suitors’ ranks— 

and now Odysseus raider of cities hit Eurydamas, 
Telemachus hit Amphimedon—Eumaeus, Polybus— 

and the cowherd stabbed Ctesippus 

right in the man’s chest and triumphed over his body: 

“Love your mockery, do you? Son of that blowhard Polytherses! 
No more shooting off your mouth, you idiot, such big talk— 
leave the last word to the gods—they’re much stronger! 
Take this spear, this guest-gift, for the cow’s hoof 

you once gave King Odysseus begging in his house!” 


So the master of longhorn cattle had his say— 
as Odysseus, fighting at close quarters, ran Agelaus 
through with a long lance—Telemachus speared Leocritus 
so deep in the groin the bronze came punching out his back 
and the man crashed headfirst, slamming the ground full-face. 
And now Athena, looming out of the rafters high above them, 
brandished her man-destroying shield of thunder, terrifying 


[276-310]

the suitors out of their minds, and down the hall they panicked— 


wild, like herds stampeding, driven mad as the darting gadfly 
strikes in the late spring when the long days come round. 
The attackers struck like eagles, crook-clawed, hook-beaked, 
swooping down from a mountain ridge to harry smaller birds 
that skim across the flatland, cringing under the clouds 
but the eagles plunge in fury, rip their lives out—hopeless, 
never a chance of flight or rescue—and people love the sport— 
so the attackers routed suitors headlong down the hall, 
wheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right 
and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open— 
the whole floor awash with blood. 

Leodes now— 


320 


[310-41] BOOK 22: SLAUGHTER IN THE 


he flung himself at Odysseus, clutched his knees, 
crying out to the king with a sudden, winging prayer: 
“I hug your knees, Odysseus—mercy! spare my life! 
Never, I swear, did I harass any woman in your house— 
never a word, a gesture—nothing, no, I tried 

to restrain the suitors, whoever did such things. 

They wouldn’t listen, keep their hands to themselves— 
so reckless, so they earn their shameful fate. 

But I was just their prophet— 

my hands are clean—and I’m to die their death! 

Look at the thanks I get for years of service!” 


A killing look, and the wry soldier answered, 
“Only a priest, a prophet for this mob, you say? 
How hard you must have prayed in my own house 
that the heady day of my return would never dawn— 
my dear wife would be yours, would bear your children! 
For that there’s no escape from grueling death—you die!” 


And snatching up in one powerful hand a sword 
left on the ground—Agelaus dropped it when he fell— 
Odysseus hacked the prophet square across the neck 
and the praying head went tumbling in the dust. 


Heal L 449 


330 


340 


Now one was left, 


trying still to escape black death. Phemius, Terpis’ son, 
the bard who always performed among the suitors— 
they forced the man to sing... 

There he stood, backing into the side-door, 

still clutching his ringing lyre in his hands, 

his mind in turmoil, torn—what should he do? 

Steal from the hall and crouch at the altar-stone 

of Zeus who Guards the Court, where time and again 
Odysseus and Laertes burned the long thighs of oxen? 
Or throw himself on the master’s mercy, clasp his knees? 
That was the better way—or so it struck him, yes, 

grasp the knees of Laertes’ royal son. And so, 

cradling his hollow lyre, he laid it on the ground 
between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded throne, 


350 


450 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY [342-72] 


then rushed up to Odysseus, yes, and clutched his knees, 360 
singing out to his king with a stirring, winged prayer: 

“I hug your knees, Odysseus—mercy! spare my life! 

What a grief it will be to you for all the years to come 

if you kill the singer now, who sings for gods and men. 

I taught myself the craft, but a god has planted 

deep in my spirit all the paths of song— 

songs I’m fit to sing for you as for a god. 

Calm your bloodlust now—don’t take my head! 

He’d bear me out, your own dear son Telemachus— 

never of my own will, never for any gain did I ° 370 
perform in your house, singing after the suitors 

had their feasts. They were too strong, too many— 

they forced me to come and sing—I had no choice!” 


The inspired Prince Telemachus heard his pleas 
and quickly said to his father close beside him, 
“Stop, don’t cut him down! This one’s innocent. 
So is the herald Medon—the one who always 
tended me in the house when I was little— 
spare him too. Unless he’s dead by now, 
killed by Philoetius or Eumaeus here— 380 
or ran into you rampaging through the halls.” 


The herald pricked up his anxious ears at that... 
cautious soul, he cowered, trembling, under a chair— 
wrapped in an oxhide freshly stripped—to dodge black death. 
He jumped in a flash from there, threw off the smelly hide 
and scuttling up to Telemachus, clutching his knees, 
the herald begged for life in words that fluttered: 
“Here I am, dear boy—spare me! Tell your father, 
flushed with victory, not to kill me with his sword— 
enraged as he is with these young lords who bled 390 
his palace white and showed you no respect, 
the reckless fools!” 

Breaking into a smile 

the canny Odysseus reassured him, “Courage! 
The prince has pulled you through, he’s saved you now 


[373-404] BwWOK 22: SaAUVGITER YN THE HieAekL 


so you can take it to heart and tell the next man too: 
clearly doing good puts doing bad to shame. 

Now leave the palace, go and sit outside— 

out in the courtyard, clear of the slaughter— 

you and the bard with all his many songs. 

Wait till I’ve done some household chores 

that call for my attention.” 


The two men scurried out of the house at once 
and crouched at the altar-stone of mighty Zeus— 
glancing left and right, 
fearing death would strike at any moment. 


Odysseus scanned his house to see if any man 
still skulked alive, still hoped to avoid black death. 
But he found them one and all in blood and dust .. . 
great hauls of them down and out like fish that fishermen 
drag from the churning gray surf in looped and coiling nets 
and fling ashore on a sweeping hook of beach—some noble catch 
heaped on the sand, twitching, lusting for fresh salt sea 
but the Sungod hammers down and burns their lives out... 
so the suitors lay in heaps, corpse covering corpse. 
At last the seasoned fighter turned to his son: 
“Telemachus, go, call the old nurse here— 
I must tell her all that’s on my mind.” 


Telemachus ran to do his father’s bidding, 
shook the women’s doors, calling Eurycleia: 
“Come out now! Up with you, good old woman! 
You who watch over all the household hands— 
quick, my father wants you, needs to have a word!” 


Crisp command that left the old nurse hushed— 
she spread the doors to the well-constructed hall, 
slipped out in haste, and the prince led her on... 
She found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses, 
splattered with bloody filth like a lion that’s devoured 
some ox of the field and lopes home, covered with blood, 


451 


400 


410 


420 


452 HOMER: THE ODYSSEY 


his chest streaked, both jaws glistening, dripping red— 
a sight to strike terror. So Odysseus looked now, 
splattered with gore, his thighs, his fighting hands, 
and she, when she saw the corpses, all the pooling blood, 
was about to lift a cry of triumph—here was a great exploit, 
look—but the soldier held her back and checked her zeal 
with warnings winging home: “Rejoice in your heart, 
old woman—peace! No cries of triumph now. 
It’s unholy to glory over the bodies of the dead. 
These men the doom of the gods has brought low, 
and their own indecent acts. They’d no regard 
for any man on earth—good or bad— 
who chanced to come their way. And so, thanks 
to their reckless work, they met this shameful fate. 
Quick, report in full on the women in my halls— 
who are disloyal to me, who are guiltless?” 
“Surely, child)” 
his fond old nurse replied, “now here’s the truth. 
Fifty women you have inside your house, 
women we've trained to do their duties well, 
to card the wool and bear the yoke of service. 
Some dozen in all went tramping to their shame, 
thumbing their noses at me, at the queen herself! 
And Telemachus, just now come of age—his mother 
would never let the boy take charge of the maids. 
But let me climb to her well-lit room upstairs 
and tell your wife the news— 
some god has put the woman fast asleep.” 


“Don’t wake her yet,” the crafty man returned, 
“you tell those women to hurry here at once— 
just the ones who’ve shamed us all along.” 


Away the old nurse bustled through the house 
to give the women orders, rush them to the king. 
Odysseus called Telemachus over, both herdsmen too, 
with strict commands: “Start clearing away the bodies. 
Make the women pitch in too. Chairs and tables—

scrub them down with sponges, rinse them clean. 

And once you’ve put the entire house in order, 

march the women out of the great hall—between 

the roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade— 

and hack them with your swords, slash out all their lives— 

blot out of their minds the joys of love they relished 

under the suitors’ bodies, rutting on the sly!” 470 


The women crowded in, huddling all together... 
wailing convulsively, streaming live warm tears. 
First they carried out the bodies of the dead 
and propped them under the courtyard colonnade, 
standing them one against another. Odysseus 
shouted commands himself, moving things along 
and they kept bearing out the bodies—they were forced. 
Next they scrubbed down the elegant chairs and tables, 
washed them with sopping sponges, rinsed them clean. 
Then Telemachus and the herdsmen scraped smooth 480 
the packed earth floor of the royal house with spades 
as the women gathered up the filth and piled it outside. 
And then, at last, once the entire house was put in order, 
they marched the women out of the great hall—between

crammed them into a dead end, no way out from there, 
and stern Telemachus gave the men their orders: 
“No clean death for the likes of them, by god! 
Not from me—they showered abuse on my head, 
my mother’s too! 

You sluts—the suitors’ whores!” 490 


With that, taking a cable used on a dark-prowed ship 
he coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column, 
hoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground. 
Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings 
against some snare rigged up in thickets—flying in 
for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them—

so all might die a pitiful, ghastly death... 
they kicked up heels for a little—not for long. 
Melanthius? 500 
They hauled him out through the doorway, into the court, 
lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife, 
tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw 
and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet. 
Then, 
once they’d washed their own hands and feet, 
they went inside again to join Odysseus. 
Their work was done with now. 
But the king turned to devoted Eurycleia, saying, 
“Bring sulfur, nurse, to scour all this pollution— 
bring me fire too, so I can fumigate the house. 510 
And call Penelope here with all her women— 
tell all the maids to come back in at once.” 


“Well said, my boy,” his old nurse replied, 
“right to the point. But wait, 
Jet me fetch you a shirt and cloak to wrap you. 
No more dawdling round the palace, nothing but rags 
to cover those broad shoulders—it’s a scandal!” 


“Fire first,” the good soldier answered. 
“Light me a fire to purify this house.” 


The devoted nurse snapped to his command, 520 
brought her master fire and brimstone. Odysseus 
purged his palace, halls and court, with cleansing fumes. 


Then back through the royal house the old nurse went 
to tell the women the news and bring them in at once. 
They came crowding out of their quarters, torch in hand, 
flung their arms around Odysseus, hugged him, home at last, 
and kissed his head and shoulders, seized his hands, and he, 
overcome by a lovely longing, broke down and wept... 
deep in his heart he knew them one and all.
